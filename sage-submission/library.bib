abstract = {Landscapes respond to climate, tectonic motions and sea level, but this response is mediated by sediment transport. Understanding transmission of environmental signals is crucial for predicting landscape response to climate change, and interpreting paleo‐climate and tectonics from stratigraphy. Here we propose that sediment transport can act as a nonlinear filter that completely destroys (“shreds”) environmental signals. This results from ubiquitous thresholds in sediment transport systems; e.g., landsliding, bed load transport, and river avulsion. This “morphodynamic turbulence” is analogous to turbulence in fluid flows, where energy injected at one frequency is smeared across a range of scales. We show with a numerical model that external signals are shredded when their time and amplitude scales fall within the ranges of morphodynamic turbulence. As signal frequency increases, signal preservation becomes the exception rather than the rule, suggesting a critical re‐examination of purported sedimentary signals of external forcing.},

abstract = {This work advances a unified approach to process‐based hydrologic modeling, which we term the “Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA).” The modeling framework, introduced in the companion paper, uses a general set of conservation equations with flexibility in the choice of process parameterizations (closure relationships) and spatial architecture. This second paper specifies the model equations and their spatial approximations, describes the hydrologic and biophysical process parameterizations currently supported within the framework, and illustrates how the framework can be used in conjunction with multivariate observations to identify model improvements and future research and data needs. The case studies illustrate the use of SUMMA to select among competing modeling approaches based on both observed data and theoretical considerations. Specific examples of preferable modeling approaches include the use of physiological methods to estimate stomatal resistance, careful specification of the shape of the within‐canopy and below‐canopy wind profile, explicitly accounting for dust concentrations within the snowpack, and explicitly representing distributed lateral flow processes. Results also demonstrate that changes in parameter values can make as much or more difference to the model predictions than changes in the process representation. This emphasizes that improvements in model fidelity require a sagacious choice of both process parameterizations and model parameters. In conclusion, we envisage that SUMMA can facilitate ongoing model development efforts, the diagnosis and correction of model structural errors, and improved characterization of model uncertainty.
Key Points:
Flexible model implementation enables evaluation of key modeling decisions
Case studies illustrate capabilities to identify preferable modeling approaches
Accelerates improvements in model fidelity & uncertainty characterization},

abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced significant mass loss in recent years. A substantial component of this is attributable to the retreat of marine-terminating outlet glaciers, which lose mass through increases in calving, submarine melting and terrestrial meltwater discharge. In terms of iceberg production, Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} is the largest marine-terminating glacier in Greenland, yet relatively little is known about its history before the first glacier margin observations in 1851. Two marine sediment cores obtained 15 and 19 km northwest from the mouth of Jakobshavn Isfjord were analysed to reconstruct the past behaviour of Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} and to investigate the response of the glacier system to ocean forcing. These records provide long-term ($\sim$2000) context for assessing the significance of the rapid changes in glacier stability over the last century. The X-ray imagery and high-resolution grain size analysis from both cores reveal distinct multi-centennial-scale changes in the flux of iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) from Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}. Foraminiferal analysis shows that variability in the relatively warm West Greenland Current (WGC) may have been an important driver of calving activity at Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}. We find that iceberg rafting and WGC inflow were relatively high from onset of the record, at 60 BC, until AD 1100. Subsequently, the inflow of the WGC into Disko Bugt decreased. This was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in IRD from AD 1500 to 1850, which is attributed to the establishment of a floating ice tongue. We also show that ocean warming in the 20th century is part of a longer-term warming trend in the WGC which started at around AD 1700. Finally, these new records underline the complexity of glaciomarine sediments; IRD variability was driven by the inflow of the WGC but was also modulated by a complex interplay of air temperature, sea-ice coverage and ice margin proximity.},

abstract = {Snow cover is not only a major hydrological input to the Wolf Creek Research Basin but provides a habitat for life and sustains important interactions with vegetation and climate. The losses or gains of snow within the basin and to and from the basin are therefore extremely important for the hydrology, biology and climatology of the region. This paper will review a four year record of snow studies in Wolf Creek. The sites are in the alpine, shrub-tundra and boreal forest vegetation bands of the basin and are representative of tundra plateaux, valley shrub-tundra and lowland forest respectively. At the alpine and shrub-tundra sites, wind speed, blowing snow occurrence, snow depth, temperature and humidity were measured half-hourly and snowfall and snow accumulation on the ground measured monthly. These measurements permit a mass balance of snow transformations due to blowing snow on the alpine plateaux and shrub-tundra valleys of Wolf Creek Basin. The measurements show that on average 50% of snowfall is removed from the alpine plateau and 25% is removed from low-lying shrub-tundra by blowing snow storms. Much of this snow is relocated to hillsides where it can triple snow accumulations. However, though some blowing snow is lost to sublimation, the proportion cannot yet be quantified in mountainous terrain. At the forest site, snow surveys under the canopy were compared to snowfall records in order to estimate snow interception storage and eventual sublimation. Snow remains in the canopy for weeks to months in the cold mid-winter. From 38%-45% of annual snowfall is lost to snow sublimation from spruce canopies in the lower elevations of Wolf Creek. The implications of these results are that the snow cover of Wolf Creek is controlled by its vegetation cover, exposure and climate. Changes to land use or climate in the Yukon will therefore have profound changes on the snow cover and then on the water resources, aquatic chemistry, animal populations and vegetation that are influenced by snow. Introduction Snow cover has profound implications for the environmental health, habitat and water supply of northern basins. Much of the Wolf Creek basin is covered with snow for eight months, while a few isolated alpine snow patches often survive the summer melt period to form the base for new snow accumulation in the},

Our approach, which we term the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA), formulates a general set of conservation equations, providing the flexibility to experiment with different spatial representations, different flux parameterizations, different model parameter values, and different time stepping schemes. In this paper, we introduce the general approach used in SUMMA, detailing the spatial organization and model simplifications, and how different representations of multiple physical processes can be combined within a single modeling framework. We discuss how SUMMA can be used to systematically pursue the method of multiple working hypotheses in hydrology. In particular, we discuss how SUMMA can help tackle major hydrologic modeling challenges, including defining the appropriate complexity of a model, selecting among competing flux parameterizations, representing spatial variability across a hierarchy of scales, identifying potential improvements in computational efficiency and numerical accuracy as part of the numerical solver, and improving understanding of the various sources of model uncertainty.

National Centers for Environmental Prediction and North American Regional Reanalysis atmospheric model reanalysis estimates of daily incoming shortwave radiation (Qsi), as well as the results of simplified semi-empirical calculations, were compared with measurements to determine their usefulness for hydrological calculations. It was found that all of the daily estimates show considerable bias and scatter compared with measurements. The best estimated values were produced by the semi-empirical Annandale method, particularly for simulations over the period of spring snowmelt. As many models require hourly radiation data, a method is presented for rescaling simulated daily Qsi data to the hourly values required. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2011.},

abstract = {This study investigates the dependence of net radiation at snow surfaces under forest canopies on the overlying canopy density. The daily sum of positive values of net radiation is used as an index of the snowmelt rate. Canopy cover is represented in terms of shortwave transmissivity and sky-view factor. The cases studied are a spruce forest in the Wolf Creek basin, Yukon Territory, Canada, and a pine forest near Fraser, Colorado. Of particular interest are the atmospheric conditions that favor an offset between shortwave energy attenuation and longwave irradiance enhancement by the canopy, such that net radiation does not decrease with increasing forest density. Such an offset is favored in dry climates and at high altitudes, where atmospheric emissivities are low, and in early spring when snow albedos are high and solar elevations are low. For low snow albedos, a steady decrease in snowmelt energy with increasing canopy cover is found, up to a forest density close to the actual densities of mature spruce forests. Snowmelt rates for high albedos are either insensitive or increase with increasing canopy cover. At both sites, foliage area indices close to 2 are associated with a minimum in net radiation, independent of snow albedo or cloud cover. However, these results are more uncertain for open forests because solar heating of trees may invalidate the longwave assumptions, increasing the longwave irradiance.},

abstract = {Previous studies in the Pacific Northwest have suggested a link between forest logging and increased streamflows. We present a brief overview of previous experimental efforts designed to identify mechanisms for these increases, especially during rain-on-snow (ROS) and spring snowmelt events. To extend the applicability of these data, we describe our measurement of snow accumulation, melt, and micrometeorology in existing uncut forest and shelterwood units as part of the Demonstration of Ecosystem Management Options (DEMO) study. Uncut forest units are dominated by over 100-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) with stand basal areas of ca. 40 m(2)/ha. Micrometeorology is measured 2 m above the ground surface in each 13-ha unit. Snow accumulation and melt are measured via weekly snow courses. Snowpack outflow is obtained from two 2.6 m(2) non-weighing snow lysimeters in each unit. Large (25 m(2)) weighing lysimeters provide a continuous record of snowpack evolution at scales unaffected by variability in canopy throughfall. Snow interception is measured by continuous weighing of cut trees. Harvest treatments will be imposed during summer 1998 and additional post-harvest data will be collected. Pre-harvest data indicate up to 60% greater (33 mm) 3-day production of runoff and 150% greater (22 mm) 3-day snowmelt (outflow minus throughfall) in the shelterwood than in the uncut forest unit during ROS events. Snowmelt during radiation-dominated spring events is ca. 50% greater (15 mm) in the shelterwood. Results from the weighing lysimeters show high correlation with snow course data from the shelterwood but poor correlation with those from the uncut forest due to small scale spatial variability in tree canopy cover.},

abstract = {Rain-on-snow (ROS) is a major contributor to flooding and landslides in many temperate coastal watersheds around the world. Research has shown that forest harvesting can increase melt rates during ROS at both the stand and watershed scale. Because of this, post disturbance hydrological recovery is of interest in watersheds where forest management is prevalent. Recent research that pairs events by frequency rather than chronologically has indicated that forest cover removal can have a significant effect on the magnitude and frequency of extreme events, which is counter to the dominant view in forest hydrology. Hydrological modelling provides a means to apply frequency based analysis in watersheds with short data records, but models must be tested and validated in coastal watersheds before they can be applied extensively. A key challenge to testing models is the inherent difficulty with collecting data in ROS environments. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to design a methodology that recorded previously unobserved processes, use these data to validate model simulations and assess stand level energy flux recovery during ROS. Data were collected at a range of elevations within recently harvested, regenerating and old growth forests. The Cold Regions Hydrological Model generally performed well at capturing the dynamics of snow accumulation and melt, however, snow water equivalent was generally over-predicted. Depths of transient snowpacks were generally under-predicted, however, once a snowpack was established model performance improved. Clear-cut forests had higher mean and greater variability of energy inputs resulting in large events occurring more frequently than in old or second growth forests. Energy flux recovery was evident within the regenerating forests; however, both the rates of recovery and differences among stands depended on the location and the variables compared. When either the mean or standard deviation of energy inputs differed from that of old growth forests, energy flux recovery was reduced as events became larger and less frequent. It is probable that results obtained from this study will translate to stream flow in watersheds with steep slopes, shallow soils and extensive preferential flow networks (i.e. high run-off coefficients), especially when run-off generating areas are synchronized.},

abstract = {The possibility of determining snow water equivalent (SWE) by the use of an acoustic impulse was assessed at two field locations in Saskatchewan and British Columbia, Canada. These sites represent cold windswept prairie and temperate deep mountain snowcovers. A continuous frequency‐swept acoustic wave was sent into the snowpack and received. Signal processing was then subsequently used to estimate the depth and density of each snow layer by a recursive relationship involving frequency‐modulated continuous‐wave (FMCW) radar and seismological techniques. From this method, it is also shown that the tortuosity of snow can be estimated. Data collected by gravimetric sampling was used as comparison to the SWE values determined by the use of acoustic sounding. The results showed that for the Saskatchewan sites, the correlation between the measured and the modeled values of SWE was 0{\textperiodcentered}86, whereas at the British Columbia sites, the correlation was 0{\textperiodcentered}78. The difference in the correlations was interpreted as being due to additional acoustic measurement error at the British Columbia sites caused by higher liquid water contents and more layers in the snowpack. The measured and the modeled SWE for Saskatchewan snowpacks with high liquid water contents were found to be weakly associated with correlations of 0{\textperiodcentered}30. The acoustically‐determined values of tortuosity were close to unity ($\alpha$ ≈ 1), which is in agreement with the values characteristic of snow as a porous substance. Further research is necessary to determine whether this technique can be applied to snow in other environmental conditions. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Several abrupt climate events during the Holocene, including the widely documented oscillation at 8.2 thousand years before present (ka), are attributed to changes in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Additional mechanisms, such as interactions between atmospheric circulation, ice-sheet dynamics, and the influence of solar irradiance, also have been proposed to explain abrupt climatic events, but evidence remains elusive. This study presents evidence from multi-proxy analyses on the Holocene sediments of Eleanor Lake, interior British Columbia. Climatic inferences from our decadal-resolution record of biogenic silica (BSi) abundance are supported by changes in diatom and pollen assemblages from the same core and correlations with existing regional climate records. The BSi record reveals abrupt and persistent climatic shifts at 10.2, 9.3, and 8.5. ka, the latter two of which are coeval with major collapses of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The record also reveals a short-term cooling at 8.2. ka that is distinct from the 8.5. ka event and similar in magnitude to several other late-Holocene coolings. BSi is correlated with solar-irradiance indices (r=0.43-0.61), but the correlation is opposite in sign to that expected from direct solar forcing and weakens after 8. ka. Possible mechanisms causing the abrupt and persistent climate changes of the early Holocene include 1) sudden losses of ice and proglacial lake extent, causing a shift in the meridional structure of atmospheric circulation, 2) a possible link between solar minima and El Ni{\~{n}}o-like conditions that are correlated with warm spring temperature in interior British Columbia, and 3) the influence of solar irradiance variability on the position of the polar jet, possibly via effects on the strength of the glacial anticyclone. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Generating fine-scale time series of intermittent rainfall that are fully consistent with any given coarse-scale totals is a key and open issue in many hydrological problems. We propose a stationary disaggregation method that simulates rainfall time series with given dependence structure, wet/dry probability, and marginal distribution at a target finer (lower-level) time scale, preserving full consistency with variables at a parent coarser (higher-level) time scale. We account for the intermittent character of rainfall at fine time scales by merging a discrete stochastic representation of intermittency and a continuous one of rainfall depths. This approach yields a unique and parsimonious mathematical framework providing general analytical formulations of mean, variance, and autocorrelation function (ACF) for a mixed-type stochastic process in terms of mean, variance, and ACFs of both continuous and discrete components, respectively. To achieve the full consistency between variables at finer and coarser time scales in terms of marginal distribution and coarse-scale totals, the generated lower-level series are adjusted according to a procedure that does not affect the stochastic structure implied by the original model. To assess model performance, we study rainfall process as intermittent with both independent and dependent occurrences, where dependence is quantified by the probability that two consecutive time intervals are dry. In either case, we provide analytical formulations of main statistics of our mixed-type disaggregation model and show their clear accordance with Monte Carlo simulations. An application to rainfall time series from real world is shown as a proof of concept.},

Information on the timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or changing climate conditions is required for successful water and resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model ISNOBAL is used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km2, with simulation periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and watershed management.},

abstract = {Atlin Lake in northern British Columbia and southern Yukon Territory is the largest natural lake in the North American Cordillera (791 km2). Inflow from the Juneau Ice Field delivers large volumes of sediment to the proximal basins of Willison Bay and Llewellyn Inlet. Sediment is distributed by interflow and underflow through these basins. Based on acoustic data, each of these basins contain Holocene deposits about 120 m thick, representing mean annual accumulation since deglaciation of more than 1 cm/a. Cores confirm this, except that the formation of a small lake at the toe of Llewellyn Glacier during about the past 50 years is trapping sediment and has reduced accumulation in Llewellyn Inlet by an order of magnitude. Sills separate these basins from the main body of Atlin Lake and Torres Channel where accumulation is much less, averaging about 1-4 mm/a during the history of the lake. Late Pleistocene glacilacustrine sediment occurs as a thin, patchy deposit and is overlain by up to 10 m of Holocene lacustrine deposits. Unlike other large lakes in the Cordillera with thick late Pleistocene deposits indicating large volumes of sediment contributed by glaciers in the lakes and their basins, the pattern in Atlin Lake documents rapid retreat of glaciers from the lake and much of the drainage basin. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapour were studied in a 7.5 ha clearing in Marmot Creek Research Basin, located in the Kananaskis River Basin in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. A locally homogeneous site surrounded by forested mountainous terrain was instrumented allowing 5-level profile measurements of wind speed, temperature, and water vapour, as well as two levels of eddy covariance measurement. Mean profiles exhibit logarithmic distribution with height up to 2.5 m height. The momentum roughness length values, z 0m derived from the eddy covariance measurements were at least an order of magnitude larger than typical values over snow, indicating that the air flow was much more turbulent than would be expected from shear stress developed at the snow surface. Accordingly, the measured wind profile did not match to the expected wind profile using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and first-order closure methods. Despite this discordance, the increased turbulence appears to be well matched to the temperature and water vapour profiles, confirming the measured latent and sensible heat fluxes. Gravimetric evaporation measurements provided further agreement with the latent heat flux measured by the eddy covariance technique. The failure of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory at this site suggests that the application of flux estimation techniques that are based on flux-profile relationships would predict smaller heat flux values than those that were measured.},

abstract = {Temperature index or degree-day models rest upon a claimed relationship between snow or ice melt and air temperature usually expressed in the form of positive temperatures. Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview of temperature-index methods, including glacier environments, and discusses recent advances on distributed approaches attempting to account for topographic effects in complex terrain, while retaining scarcity of data input. In the light of an increasing demand for melt estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution, such approaches need further refinement and development.},

abstract = {Precipitation intercepted by forests plays a major role in more than one-fourth of the global land area's hydrologic cycle. Direct in situ measurement of intercepted precipitation is challenging, and thus, it is typically indirectly estimated through comparing precipitation under forest cover and in the open. We discuss/compare measurement methods for forest precipitation interception beyond classical budgeting and then recommend future directions for improving water storage estimation. Comparison of techniques shows that methods submerging tree components produce the largest water storage capacity values. Whole-tree lysimeters have been used with great success at quantifying water storage for the integrated system yet are unable to separate trunk versus canopy storage. Remote sensing, particularly signal attenuation, may permit this separation. Mechanical displacement methods show great promise and variety of techniques: pulley/spring system, branch strain sensors, trunk compression sensors and photography. Relating wind sway to water storage also shows great promise with negligible environmental disruption yet is currently at the proof-of-concept stage. Suggested future directions focus on development of common features regarding all discussed methods: (i) measurement uncertainties or processes beyond interception influencing the observed signal, (ii) scaling approaches to move from single tree components to the single-tree and forest scales and (iii) temporal scaling to estimate the relevance of single-interception components over longer timescales. Through addressing these research needs, we hope the scientific community can develop an 'integrated' monitoring plan incorporating multiple measurement techniques to characterize forest-scale water storage dynamics while simultaneously investigating underlying (smaller-scale) components driving those dynamics across the spectrum of precipitation and forest conditions.},

abstract = {Connectivity describes the efficiency of material transfer between geomorphic system components such as hillslopes and rivers or longitudinal segments within a river network. Representations of geomorphic systems as networks should recognize that the compartments, links, and nodes exhibit connectivity at differing scales. The historical underpinnings of connectivity in geomorphology involve management of geomorphic systems and observations linking surface processes to landform dynamics. Current work in geomorphic connectivity emphasizes hydrological, sediment, or landscape connectivity. Signatures of connectivity can be detected using diverse indicators that vary from contemporary processes to stratigraphic records or a spatial metric such as sediment yield that encompasses geomorphic processes operating over diverse time and space scales. One approach to measuring connectivity is to determine the fundamental temporal and spatial scales for the phenomenon of interest and to make measurements at a sufficiently large multiple of the fundamental scales to capture reliably a representative sample. Another approach seeks to characterize how connectivity varies with scale, by applying the same metric over a wide range of scales or using statistical measures that characterize the frequency distributions of connectivity across scales. Identifying and measuring connectivity is useful in basic and applied geomorphic research and we explore the implications of connectivity for river management. Common themes and ideas that merit further research include; increased understanding of the importance of capturing landscape heterogeneity and connectivity patterns; the potential to use graph and network theory metrics in analyzing connectivity; the need to understand which metrics best represent the physical system and its connectivity pathways, and to apply these metrics to the validation of numerical models; and the need to recognize the importance of low levels of connectivity in some situations. We emphasize the value in evaluating boundaries between components of geomorphic systems as transition zones and examining the fluxes across them to understand landscape functioning. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {On the Canadian Prairies and the northern US Great Plains, snow is an important component of annual precipitation, sometimes constituting over 40% of the total, although there is much annual and regional variability. Much of this snow is transported by wind, causing substantial sublimation losses, which are reduced by obstacles and topographic features on the landscape that reduce snow transport and trap snow. Agroforestry configurations trap snow and reduce the amount and distance of snow movement and, because of this, reduce the amount of moisture lost to sublimation. The planning of agroforestry measures should therefore take into account their effects on snow hydrology. In this study, the effects of shelterbelts on snow quantity and distribution are shown over multiple years, including a number of locations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Results show that snow transport reached equilibrium in 400 m or less (i. e., that sublimation rates were at their maximum beyond 400 m leeward of a shelterbelt). Also, in a paired landscape inventory, the landscape with shelterbelts had 29% more snow water equivalent (SWE) than the unsheltered landscape. Site-specific meteorological data was used in the Prairie Blowing Snow Model, now a component of the Cold Regions Hydrological Model, to calculate the effects of agroforestry configurations on snow water conservation. Modeled snow distribution agreed well with measured snow at Conquest, Saskatchewan, in the winter of 2009/2010. Using actual weather data for the same location for the period 1996-2011, the model calculated the annual sublimation from 200 m wide fields protected by shelterbelts to be up to 12.5 mm less than similar unsheltered fields. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been described as spoilage organisms in vacuum-packed cooked ham. A Fractional Factorial Design was performed to investigate the relative merits of sodium chloride, sodium lactate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium erythorbate, nisin and pediocin, in limiting the Lactobacillus sakei growth in broth culture. This allowed rejection of sodium chloride, sodium lactate and sodium erythorbate (no significant effects on growth), and a Central Composite Rotatable Design broth culture study was performed comparing the effects of nisin and pediocin. From this study, nisin was identified as a more important variable for inclusion into a cooked ham model (significant effects on growth parameters: logarithmic increase in the population, exponential microbial growth rate and lag phase extension). The validation of this outcome in a model formulation of vacuum-packed sliced cooked ham (0.001%, 0.007% and 0.013% of nisin) stored for 60 days, confirmed the inhibitory effect of nisin on total LAB growth.},

To explore this uncertainty, three commonly used methods for calculating the albedo of vegetated surfaces are compared, taking observed snow and vegetation distributions as inputs. Surprisingly, all three methods produce similar results and compare reasonably well with observations over seasonally snow-covered regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It appears that some climate models use unrealistic parameter values, and snow albedo masking need not be as large a source of uncertainty as it is in current climate projections.

abstract = {The threshold wind speed for snow transport is related to properties of the surface snowpack: snow particle bonding, cohesion, and kinetic friction. These properties are controlled by meteorological factors. A method is proposed that relates the threshold wind speed for the initiation of snow transport to standard surface meteorological observations. A complete dataset on the hourly threshold condition for snow transport as determined from visual observation was developed for 16 stations on the prairies of western Canada over six winters. The threshold wind speeds for wet snow transport are significantly different from those for dry snow transport. The majority of recorded threshold 10-m wind speeds ranged from 7 to 14 m s-1 with an average of 9.9 m s-1 for wet snow transport, and from 4 to 11 m s-1 with an average of 7.7 m s-1 for dry snow transport. The observations display a nonlinear but generally positive correlation between threshold wind speed and air temperature. An empirical model between threshold wind speed and air temperature was developed for dry snow conditions. The model, on average, provides a good estimate of the threshold wind speed.},

This technique provides flux rates of allochthonous minerogenic deposition for the last 13,840 years. The Pleistocene/Holocene transition is characterized by instable soils and vegetation caused by adjustment of the catchment to interglacial climatic conditions. These instabilities are the reason for elevated mean sediment yields in the catchment of 16 t km-2yr-1until 9800 cal. BP. During most of the Holocene erosive processes are insignificant and sediment yields are very low (1.5 t km-2yr-1). Since humans cleared the forests for agriculture and early industrial purposes the natural environment has been disturbed and sediment yields increased to mean values of 14 t km-2yr-1 during the last 2750 years. Comparisons of reconstructions from the Eifel area with similar data from southern Sweden and with measured data from lakes, reservoirs and monitoring sites suggest that quantitative reconstructions based on Lake Holzmaar sediments may be regarded as reliable despite uncertainties related to the methods of reconstruction applied. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Measurements of the dependence of snow albedo on wavelength, zenith angle, grain size, impurity content, and cloud cover can be interpreted in terms of single‐scattering and multiple‐scattering radiative transfer theory. Ice is very weakly absorptive in the visible (minimum absorption at $\lambda$ = 0.46 µm) but has strong absorption bands in the near infrared (near IR). Snow albedo is therefore much lower in the near IR. The near‐IR solar irradiance thus plays an important role in snowmelt and in the energy balance at a snow surface. The near‐IR albedo is very sensitive to snow grain size and moderately sensitive to solar zenith angle. The visible albedo (for pure snow) is not sensitive to these parameters but is instead affected by snowpack thickness and parts‐per‐million amounts (or less) of impurities. Grain size normally increases as the snow ages, causing a reduction in albedo. If the grain size increases as a function of depth, the albedo may suffer more reduction in the visible or in the near IR, depending on the rate of grain size increase. The presence of liquid water has little effect per se on snow optical properties in the solar spectrum, in contrast to its enormous effect on microwave emissivity. Snow albedo is increased at all wavelengths as the solar zenith angle increases but is most sensitive around $\lambda$ =1 µm. Many apparently conflicting measurements of the zenith angle dependence of albedo are difficult to interpret because of modeling error, instrument error, and inadequate documentation of grain size, surface roughness, and incident radiation spectrum. Cloud cover affects snow albedo both by converting direct radiation into diffuse radiation and also by altering the spectral distribution of the radiation. Cloud cover normally causes an increase in spectrally integrated snow albedo. Some measurements of spectral flux extinction in snow are difficult to reconcile with the spectral albedo measurements. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function which apportions the reflected solar radiation among the various reflection angles must be known in order to interpret individual satellite measurements. It has been measured at the snow surface and at the top of the atmosphere, but its dependence on wavelength, snow grain size, and surface roughness is still unknown. Thermal infrared emissivity of snow is close to 100% but is a few percent lower at large viewing angles than for overhead viewing. It is very insensitive to grain size, impurities, snow depth, liquid water content, or density. Solar reflectance and microwave emissivity are both sensitive to various of these snowpack parameters. However, none of these parameters can be uniquely determined by satellite measurements at a single wavelength; a multichannel method is thus necessary if they are to be determined by remote sensing.},

abstract = {Gridded precipitation and temperature products are inherently uncertain because of myriad factors, including interpolation from a sparse observation network, measurement representativeness, and measurement errors. Generally uncertainty is not explicitly accounted for in gridded products of precipitation or temperature; if it is represented, it is often included in an ad hoc manner. A lack of quantitative uncertainty estimates for hydrometeorological forcing fields limits the application of advanced data assimilation systems and other tools in land surface and hydrologic modeling. This study develops a gridded, observation-based ensemble of precipitation and temperature at a daily increment for the period 1980-2012 for the conterminous United States, northern Mexico, and southern Canada. This allows for the estimation of precipitation and temperature uncertainty in hydrologic modeling and data assimilation through the use of the ensemble variance. Statistical verification of the ensemble indicates that it has generally good reliability and discrimination of events of various magnitudes but has a slight wet bias for high threshold events (>50 mm). The ensemble mean is similar to other widely used hydrometeorological datasets but with some important differences. The ensemble product produces a more realistic occurrence of precipitation statistics (wet day fraction), which impacts the empirical derivation of other fields used in land surface and hydrologic modeling. In terms of applications, skill in simulations of streamflow in 671 headwater basins is similar to other coarse-resolution datasets. This is the first version, and future work will address temporal correlation of precipitation anomalies, inclusion of other data streams, and examination of topographic lapse rate choices.},

abstract = {Trends in extreme temperature and precipitation in two regional climate model simulations forced by two global climate models are compared with observed trends over the western United States. The observed temperature extremes show substantial and statistically significant trends across the western United States during the late twentieth century, with consistent results among individual stations. The two regional climate models simulate temporal trends that are consistent with the observed trends and reflect the anthropogenic warming signal. In contrast, no such clear trends or correspondence between the observations and simulations is found for extreme precipitation, likely resulting from the dominance of the natural variability over systematic climate change during the period. However, further analysis of the variability of precipitation extremes shows strong correspondence between the observed precipitation indices and increasing oceanic Ni{\~{n}}o index (ONI), with regionally coherent patterns found for the U.S. Northwest and Southwest. Both regional climate simulations reproduce the observed relationship with ONI, indicating that the models can represent the large-scale climatic links with extreme precipitation. The regional climatemodel simulations use theWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and Hadley Centre Regional Model (HadRM) forced by the ECHAM5 and the Hadley Centre Climate Model (HadCM) global models for the 1970–2007 time period. Comparisons are made to station observations from the Historical Climatology Network (HCN) locations over the western United States.

abstract = {Recent improvements in the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model are focused on snow-vegetation-atmosphere interactions to understand how different types of vegetation affect snow processes in the mountains of Western USA. This work presents field work carried out in the Rocky Mountains of Northern Utah to evaluate new UEB model algorithms that represent the processes of canopy snow interception, sublimation, mass unloading and melt. Four years' continuous field observations showed generally smaller accumulations of snow beneath the forest canopies in comparison with open (sage and grass) areas, a difference that is attributed to interception and subsequent sublimation and redistribution of intercepted snow by wind, much of it into surrounding open areas. Accumulations beneath the denser forest (conifer) canopies were found to be less than the accumulation beneath the less dense forest (deciduous) canopies. The model was able to represent the accumulation of snow water equivalent in the open and beneath the deciduous forest quite well but without accounting for redistribution tended to overestimate the snow water equivalent beneath the conifer forest. Evidence of redistribution of the intercepted snow from the dense forest (i.e. conifer forest) to the adjacent area was inferred from observations. Including a simple representation of redistribution in the model gave satisfactory prediction of snow water equivalent beneath the coniferous forest. The simulated values of interception, sublimation and unloading were also compared with previous studies and found in agreement.},

abstract = {Accumulation of snow under forest canopies is known to decline with increasing canopy density and leaf area because of snow interception and sublimation in the canopy. Seasonal snow accumulation measurements, collected over a decade from various forest stands in western Canada, were used to test and develop methods to relate forest snow accumulation to stand properties and observations of either small-clearing seasonal snow accumulation or seasonal snowfall. At sub-stand scales, the variability of seasonal snow accumulation was not well related to stand leaf area, seasonal interception or small-clearing seasonal snow accumulation. At the stand scale, physically based snow interception equations predicted seasonal snow accumulation from the stand leaf area and the seasonal snow accumulation or snowfall in adjacent clearings. A simple parametric from of these equations showed the sensitivity of seasonal snow accumulation to leaf area at the forest stand scale and suggested a relationship to extrapolate snow accumulation or snowfall measurements from clearings to forest. These relationships, developed from Canadian boreal forest observations, are consistent with Kuz'min's (1960. Formirovanie Snezhnogo Pokrova i Metody Opredeleniya Snegozapasov. Gidrometeoizdat: Leningrad) relationship between accumulation and canopy density derived from Russian observations, suggesting a good degree of transferability.

abstract = {A transition from the global system of coal-based electricity generation to low-greenhouse-gas-emission energy technologies is required to mitigate climate change in the long term. The use of current infrastructure to build this new low-emission system necessitates additional emissions of greenhouse gases, and the coal-based infrastructure will continue to emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases as it is phased out. Furthermore, ocean thermal inertia delays the climate benefits of emissions reductions. By constructing a quantitative model of energy system transitions that includes life-cycle emissions and the central physics of greenhouse warming, we estimate the global warming expected to occur as a result of build-outs of new energy technologies ranging from 100 GW e to 10 TW e in size and 1–100 yr in duration. We show that rapid deployment of low-emission energy systems can do little to diminish the climate impacts in the first half of this century. Conservation, wind, solar, nuclear power, and possibly carbon capture and storage appear to be able to achieve substantial climate benefits in the second half of this century; however, natural gas cannot.},

abstract = {Establishing satisfactory calculation methods of lake evaporation has been crucial for research and manage- ment of water resources and ecosystems. A 30 year dataset from Dickie Lake, south-central Ontario, Canada added to the limited long-term studies on lake evaporation. Evaporation during ice-free season was calcu- lated separately using seven evaporation methods, based on field meteorology, hydrology and lake water temperature data. Actual evaporation determined during a portion of a year was estimated using a lake en- ergy budget model, and the estimation was used as reference evaporation for evaluation of the seven methods. The deviation of method-induced evaporation from the reference evaporation was compared among the seven methods, and a performance rank was proposed based on the root mean squared deviation and coeffi- cient of efficiency. As for the whole ice-free season (roughly May to November), the water balance was the best method, followed by Makkink, DeBruin-Kejiman, Penman, Priestley-Taylor, Hamon, and Jensen-Haise methods. As for shorter duration (a week to a month), the DeBruin-Kejiman was the best method, followed by Penman, Priestley-Taylor, Makkink, Hamon, Jensen-Haise, and water balance method. Annual and sea- sonal changes of energy budget terms and the compensation function of lake heat storage in evaporation flux were also analyzed.},

abstract = {Application of the energy balance approach to estimate snowmelt inherently presumes that the external energy fluxes can be measured or modeled with sufficient accuracy to reliably estimate the internal energy changes and melt rate. However, owing to difficulties in directly measuring the internal energy content of the snow during melt periods, the ability to close the energy balance is rarely quantified. To address this, all of the external energy balance terms (sensible and latent heat fluxes, shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes, and the ground heat flux) were directly measured and compared to changes of the energy content within an extensive, homogeneous, snowpack of a level field near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The snow was observed to lose significant amounts of energy because of a persistent longwave radiation imbalance caused by low incoming fluxes during cold, clear-sky periods, while solar heating of the snow surface caused an increase in the outgoing fluxes. The sum of the measured turbulent heat fluxes, ground heat flux, and solar radiation fluxes were insufficient to offset these losses, however the snowpack temperatures were not observed to cool. It was concluded that an unmeasured exchange of sensible heat was occurring from the atmosphere to the snowpack. The exchange mechanism for this is not known but would appear to be consistent with the concept of a windless exchange as employed to close the energy balance in various snow models. The results suggest that caution should be exercised when using the energy balance method to determine changes in internal energy in cold snowpacks. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Snow accumulation and ablation processes are particularly important to the hydrology of cold climate forests. In order to calculate the distribution of snow cover and the loss of snow to sublimation, the amount of snowfall intercepted by forest canopies must be determined. This paper introduces a physically-based snowfall interception model that scales snowfall interception processes from branch to canopy. Previous models of snow interception have neglected the persistent presence and subsequent unloading of intercepted snow in cold climates and hence have only been applicable to regions where snow is quickly lost from the canopy. To investigate how snow is intercepted at the forest stand scale, measurements of wind speed, air temperature, above- and below-canopy snowfall, accumulation of snow on the ground and the load of snow intercepted by a suspended, weighed, full-size conifer were collected from spruce and pine stands in the southern boreal forest. These data show that interception increases at a declining rate with increasing snowfall, to a point where the intercepted load overcomes the strength of branches to support it. Leaf area, tree species and initial canopy snow load determine the snow storage capacity of the canopy. These factors, canopy coverage and snowfall are used to calulate snow interception, presuming an exponential decay in incremental interception as cumulative snowfall increases. The subsequent unloading of intercepted snow is additionally modelled as an exponential function of time. The sensitivity of the combined model to temperature, wind speed, snowfall, snow load and canopy structure is examined for weekly time-steps. The examination shows that interception efficiency is particularly sensitive to snowfall amount, canopy density and time since snowfall. A comparison of the model with weekly measurements of snow interception suggests that the method can be used to caluculate snow interception successfully in a physically-based manner.},

abstract = {Pretreatment of sediment with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic constituents and aid deflocculation is a common component of particle size analyses of terrestrial and marine sediments. This study quantitatively determined the effect of a range of treatment levels on particle size distribution among four sediment types representing a range of mineral/organic particle size distributions, organic content and particle characterisation (charcoal or detrital plant material). The hypothesis was that complete removal of organic particles would lead to improved repeatability of results for a given sample and treatment level. Repeatability was assessed with a coefficient of variance calculation and a comparison of particle size distribution patterns within and across treatments. The effect of treatment levels on commonly used distribution descriptors (e.g. texture ratios and measures of central tendency) were then examined for each sample. Samples characterised primarily by detrital material responded most readily to treatment, whereas charcoal-dominated samples required higher levels of treatment to achieve increased repeatability and disappearance of large organic particles. Certain distribution descriptors, such as modal analysis, were found to be more resilient to organic particle presence, although amplitude of the organic distribution and the degree of overlap with the inorganic signal in some cases obscured even this metric. Thus, final treatment recommendations are based on sample characteristics and the types of distribution descriptors used in a study.},

abstract = {This guide to estimating daily and monthly actual, potential, reference crop and pan evaporation covers topics that are of interest to researchers, consulting hydrologists and practicing engineers. Topics include estimating actual evaporation from deep lakes and from farm dams and for catchment water balance studies, estimating potential evaporation as input to rainfall-runoff models, and reference crop evapotranspiration for small irrigation areas, and for irrigation within large irrigation districts. Inspiration for this guide arose in response to the authors' experiences in reviewing research papers and consulting reports where estimation of the actual evaporation component in catchment and water balance studies was often inadequately handled. Practical guides using consistent terminology that cover both theory and practice are not readily available. Here we provide such a guide, which is divided into three parts. The first part provides background theory and an outline of the conceptual models of potential evaporation of Penman, Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor, as well as discussions of reference crop evapotranspiration and Class-A pan evaporation. The last two sub-sections in this first part include techniques to estimate actual evaporation from (i) open-surface water and (ii) landscapes and catchments (Morton and the advection-aridity models). The second part addresses topics confronting a practicing hydrologist, e.g. estimating actual evaporation for deep lakes, shallow lakes and farm dams, lakes covered with vegetation, catchments, irrigation areas and bare soil. The third part addresses six related issues: (i) automatic (hard wired) calculation of evaporation estimates in commercial weather stations, (ii) evaporation estimates without wind data, (iii) at-site meteorological data, (iv) dealing with evaporation in a climate change environment, (v) 24 h versus day-light hour estimation of meteorological variables, and (vi) uncertainty in evaporation estimates. This paper is supported by a Supplement that includes 21 sections enhancing the material in the text, worked examples of many procedures discussed in the paper, a program listing (Fortran 90) of Morton's WREVAP evaporation models along with tables of monthly Class-A pan coefficients for 68 locations across Australia and other information. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.

abstract = {The primary advantage of Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) algorithm is that it outperforms other optimization techniques in both convergence speed and searching ability for parameter sets that satisfy statistical guidelines while requiring only one algorithm parameter (perturbation factor) in the optimization process. Conventionally, a default value of 0.2 is used as the perturbation factor, where a normal distribution is applied with mean sampling distribution of zero and variance of one. However, the perturbation factor sensitivity to the performance of DDS for watershed modeling is still unknown. The fixed-form sampling distribution may result in finding parameters at the local scale rather than global in the sampling space. In this study, the efficiency of DDS was evaluated by altering the perturbation factor (from 0.05 to 1.00) and the selection of sampling distribution (normal and uniform) on hydrologic and water quality predictions in a lowland agricultural watershed in Texas, United States. Results show that the use of altered perturbation factor may cause variations in convergence speed or the ability to find better solutions. In addition, DDS results were found to be very sensitive to sampling distribution selections, where DDS-N (normal distribution) outperformed DDS-U (uniform distribution) in all case scenarios. The choice of sampling distributions could be the potential major factor to be attributed for the performance of auto-calibration techniques for watershed simulation models.},

abstract = {A global overview of glacier advances and retreats (grouped by regions and by millennia) for the Holocene is compiled from previous studies. The reconstructions of glacier fluctuations are based on 1) mapping and dating moraines defined by14C, TCN, OSL, lichenometry and tree rings (discontinuous records/time series), and 2) sediments from proglacial lakes and speleothems (continuous records/time series). Using 189 continuous and discontinuous time series, the long-term trends and centennial fluctuations of glaciers were compared to trends in the recession of Northern and mountain tree lines, and with orbital, solar and volcanic studies to examine the likely forcing factors that drove the changes recorded. A general trend of increasing glacier size from the early-mid Holocene, to the late Holocene in the extra-tropical areas of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is related to overall summer temperature, forced by orbitally-controlled insolation. The glaciers in New Zealand and in the tropical Andes also appear to follow the orbital trend, i.e., they were decreasing from the early Holocene to the present. In contrast, glacier fluctuations in some monsoonal areas of Asia and southern South America generally did not follow the orbital trends, but fluctuated at a higher frequency possibly triggered by distinct teleconnections patterns. During the Neoglacial, advances clustered at 4.4-4.2ka, 3.8-3.4ka, 3.3-2.8ka, 2.6ka, 2.3-2.1ka, 1.5-1.4ka, 1.2-1.0ka, 0.7-0.5ka, corresponding to general cooling periods in the North Atlantic. Some of these episodes coincide with multidecadal periods of low solar activity, but it is unclear what mechanism might link small changes in irradiance to widespread glacier fluctuations. Explosive volcanism may have played a role in some periods of glacier advances, such as around 1.7-1.6ka (coinciding with the Taupo volcanic eruption at 232±5CE) but the record of explosive volcanism is poorly known through the Holocene. The compilation of ages suggests that there is no single mechanism driving glacier fluctuations on a global scale. Multidecadal variations of solar and volcanic activity supported by positive feedbacks in the climate system may have played a critical role in Holocene glaciation, but further research on such linkages is needed. The rate and the global character of glacier retreat in the 20th through early 21st centuries appears unusual in the context of Holocene glaciation, though the retreating glaciers in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere are still larger today than they were in the early and/or mid-Holocene. The current retreat, however, is occurring during an interval of orbital forcing that is favorable for glacier growth and is therefore caused by a combination of factors other than orbital forcing, primarily strong anthropogenic effects. Glacier retreat will continue into future decades due to the delayed response of glaciers to climate change.},

@article{Marsh1997,
abstract = {During snowmelt over a continuous snow cover, the vertical turbulent exchanges of sensible and latent energy are influenced by regional air-mass characteristics, which exert a strong control on air temperature. In high-latitude sites, the melting surface rapidly becomes heterogeneous, with patches of snow and snow-free areas. Local advection occurs when near-surface air layers are warmed due to sensible heat flux from the snow-free areas, with the resulting heat transferred horizontally to adjacent snowpatches. This advection greatly increases the rate of snowmelt along the leading edges of the snowpatches. In order to estimate correctly the average melt rates of the snowpatches and the bulk energy balance of the entire landscape, it is necessary to estimate the local advection component. To date, few studies have dealt with this problem. This paper reports results from an Arctic tundra site located approximately 55 km northeast of Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada. The importance of local advection is estimated by comparing the sensible heat flux of the snowpatches to estimates of sensible heat without local advection. This latter term is derived from a relationship between upper air temperature and sensible heat flux over a continuous snow cover. This work has important implications for developing models that correctly represent the cryosphere of tundra regions, and in developing appropriate scaling techniques for heterogeneous landscapes.},

The portable field devices were tested at forest and tundra sites near Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, and at forest and meadow sites in the Rocky Mountains, Alberta, Canada. Comparisons were made between the acoustic technique and gravimetric sampling, which was conducted using snowpits, density samples of individual snow layers and an ESC30 "snow tube" snow density sampler and ruler. These comparisons demonstrated that the acoustic measurement with the portable field unit and on-line modified signal processing technique can provide SWE estimates in the field that are of comparable accuracy to SWE calculated from gravimetric samples. The on-line processing allows the operator to gauge the reliability of the measurement and to ensure sufficient data collection before leaving the field site. Significant advantages over gravimetric sampling accrue from non-destructive sampling of the snowpack and ease of measurement. A sensitivity analysis of the acoustic model is presented. Limitations and aspects for further research are also discussed.},

Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.},

Mass balance was slightly below zero around 1970 and has been growing more negative since then. Excluding peripheral ice bodies in Greenland and Antarctica, global average specific balance for 1961 – 1990 was 219 ± 112 kg m2 a1, representing 0.33 ± 0.17 mm SLE (sea-level equivalent) a1. For 2001 – 2004, the figures are 510 ± 101 kg m2 a1 and 0.77±0.15 mm SLE a1. Including the smaller Greenland and Antarctic glaciers, global total balance becomes 0.38 ± 0.19 mm SLE a1 for 1961–1990 and 0.98 ± 0.19 mm SLE a1 for 2001– 2004. For 1991 – 2004 the glacier contribution, 0.77± 0.26 mm SLE a1, is 20–30% of a recent estimate of 3.2 ± 0.4 mm a1 of total sea-level rise for 1993–2005. While our error estimates are not rigorous, we believe them to be liberal as far as they go, but we also discuss several unquantified biases of which any may prove to be significant.},

abstract = {Snow density is important information for a wide range of activities including avalanche control, marketing, building-code development, weather forecasting, and water supply forecasting. Extended recent high-quality datasets from the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest coastal area are rare. This paper presents a study of an unusually long and continuous (January 1990 to April 2016) manually collected dataset of fresh snowfall measurements for Whistler Mountain, British Columbia, Canada. The dataset consists of snowboard core measurements that were collected by Whistler-Blackcomb ski patrol staff twice daily for avalanche control and resort-marketing purposes. These records were collated, transcribed, quality controlled, and made computer accessible in this study. A discussion of the characteristics of the data collection site and an assessment of data reliability are presented. Two examples of the many purposes to which this high-quality dataset might be put were studied. Climatic teleconnections to winter (December-February) mean snow density were examined, which revealed a positive relationship to the quadratic form of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation pattern (i.e., PDO
2
). In addition, an analysis of daily snow density relationships to air mass types was performed, which suggested that higher (lower) densities are associated with maritime inflow (arctic outflow) conditions. Both of these relationships appear to be mediated by the positive correlation between snow density and air temperature.
Based on the full dataset (N = 1275 individual snow density measurements) for all months with measured snowfall, annual snowfall season (November to May) mean snow densities ranged from 77 kg m
−3
to 109 kg m

abstract = {A numerical model has been developed to simulate energy and mass evolution of snow cover at a given location, as a function of meteorological conditions: precipitation, air temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and incoming short-wave and long-wave radiation. This model, named CROCUS, was first tested on a well-instrumented field during a whole winter, showing its ability to simulate the important phenomena affecting the evolution of the snow layers: high temperature gradients, wetting, compaction, and melting-freezing cycles. A second test was conducted at two locations in the French network used for operational avalanche forecasting. Though the weather observations are made there only twice daily, the snow profiles calculated by the model were very close to those obtained once a week by a pit observation. CROCUS proved itself sufficient to be considered now as a useful objective tool for operational avalanche forecasting.},

abstract = {The origins and results of the scientific experiments in Marmot Creek Experimental Watershed, now the Marmot Creek Research Basin, over more than 50 years are reviewed. Marmot Creek was established to better understand how forest manipulations could be used to manage streamflow hydrographs and was actively manipulated in the 1970s and 1980s. While small forest clearings were shown to increase snow accumulation consistently, the impacts on melt rates depended on clearing size, slope and aspect. As a result, clearing treatments whether through large cutblocks or small clearings had modest impacts on the hydrograph timing and variability and only local impacts on streamflow volume. Changes in climate are primarily manifested as warming which has substantially reduced snowpacks at low elevations. These climate changes have not been evident in hydrograph change and there is no trend to volumes or timing of streamflow over the last 50 years. Overall the basin shows remarkable resiliency to climate and land use change due to its wide range of elevations, slopes, snow environments and sub-surface storage. The basin has become a hydrological process observatory where multi-scale models are developed and evaluated for operation over larger areas. It has served an invaluable role for this and the scientific results from Marmot Creek have supported the development of global climate models and hydrological models that are now applied throughout the world.},

abstract = {A model including slope effects on snow redistribution, interception and energetics was developed using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model platform, parameterized with minimal calibration and manipulated to simulate the impacts of forest disturbance on mountain hydrology. A total of 40 forest disturbance scenarios were compared with the current land cover for four simulation years. Disturbance scenarios ranged from the impact of pine beetle kill of lodgepole pine to clear-cutting of north- or south-facing slopes, forest fire and salvage logging. Pine beetle impacts were small in all cases with increases in snowmelt volume of less than 10% and streamflow volume of less than 2%. This small impact is attributed to the low and relatively dry elevations of lodgepole pine forests in the basin. Forest disturbances due to fire and clear-cutting affected much larger areas and higher elevations of the basin and were generally more than twice as effective as pine beetle in increasing snowmelt or streamflow. For complete forest cover removal by burning and salvage logging, a 45% increase in snowmelt volume was simulated; however, this only translated into a 5% increase in spring and summer streamflow volume. Forest burning with the retention of standing burned trunks was the most effective forest cover treatment for increasing streamflow (up to 8%) because of its minimizing of winter snow sublimation losses from interception and blowing snow. However, increases in streamflow volumes were almost entirely due to reductions in intercepted snow sublimation with decreasing canopy coverage. Peak daily streamflow discharges responded more strongly to forest cover disturbance than did seasonal streamflow volumes, with increases of almost 25% in peak streamflow from the removal of forest canopy by fire and the retention of standing burned trunks. Peak flow was most effectively increased by forest removal on south-facing slopes and level sites. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A 1250 km2 3D seismic volume is used to provide a detailed spatial and geometrical analysis of fifteen Pleistocene tunnel valleys in the Danish North Sea. All the valleys are buried; they are up to 39 km long, 3-4 km wide and up to 350 m deep. The valleys are part of a vast tunnel valley province covering an area of some 0.5 million km2 of the formerly glaciated lowland areas of North West Europe. The valleys consist of non-branching, non-anastomosing troughs; they exhibit strongly undulating bottom profiles with numerous sub-basins and thresholds, and are characterised by adverse end slopes. Cross-cutting relationships and theoretical considerations suggest the occurrence of seven major episodes of valley incision attributed to ice marginal oscillations within a few glacials. Calculations considering the valley end gradients and theoretical ice-surface profiles suggest that the valleys were formed by pressurised subglacial meltwater erosion. Given a range of theoretical ice-surface profiles, the adverse end slopes are well beyond the supercooling threshold, which suggests that the water was not in thermal equilibrium with the basal ice and that flow was concentrated in substantial conduits with sufficient mass and flux to maintain water temperature well above the freezing point.

abstract = {The influence of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent and covariance between spatial distributions of ablation and snow water equivalent on depletion of snowcover was investigated in the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan, Canada. Changes in the spatial distributions of snow water equivalent were measured before and during melt in five stands, ranked by canopy density as: black spruce, jack pine, mixed wood, burned and recent clear-cut. The pre-melt frequency distribution of snow water equivalent within forest stands was found to fit a log-normal distribution. Higher variability in snow water equivalent resulted in earlier exposure of ground under spatially uniform melt simulations, confirming the previous findings of others for open environments. The spatial distribution of daily ablation within stands was found, however, to be correlated inversely to the distribution of snow water equivalent. This negative covariance between snow water equivalent and ablation further accelerated snow cover depletion. The combined acceleration as a result of variance of snow water equivalent and covariance with ablation was greatest in mixed-wood stands and smallest in burned and spruce stands. Simulations that included the within-stand covariance of ablation and snow water equivalent improved fit with measured data over those that only considered the effect of the distribution of snow water equivalent on snow-cover depletion.

abstract = {To determine for how long a landslide affects sediment discharge, the sediment yields of 15 check-dam basins were compared with the time series of landslide distributions in a mountain basin in the Tanzawa region, central Japan. The distribution of sediment yield was quantitatively estimated from deposition in the sediment pools of check dams. The relationship between the landslide history and sediment discharge in the Nakagawa River basin was examined for an approximately 80-year period. Two major landslide events occurred during this period: the 1923 Kanto Earthquake and the 1972 disaster caused by heavy rainfall. The resulting trend in sediment discharge of the whole basin, estimated using reservoir sedimentation in the Miho Dam at its base, was nearly constant, with high sediment discharge (2897 m3km- 2yr- 1) in the intervening quarter-century, despite the recovery of vegetation on landslide areas in this period. Comparisons of the landslide distributions resulting from the two disasters, the sediment yields of check-dam basins, and the sediment discharge of the whole basin indicate that recent sediment discharge contains landslide debris that was originated by the Kanto Earthquake that occurred over 80 years ago. Thus, to understand high sediment discharge, it is essential to investigate not only the current basin condition and recent events, but also the landslide history of the basin for at least the previous 100 years. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Over the past 50 years, retreating glaciers and ice caps contributed 0.5 mm yr−1 to sea-level rise1 , and one third of this contribution is believed to come from ice masses bordering the Gulf of Alaska2,3. However, these estimates of ice loss in Alaska are based on measurements of a limited number of glaciers that are extrapolated to constrain ice wastage in the many thousands of others. Uncertainties in these estimates arise, for example, from the complex pattern of decadal elevation changes at the scale of individual glaciers and mountain ranges4–7. Here we combine a comprehensive glacier inventory with elevation changes derived from sequential digital elevation models. We find that between 1962 and 2006, Alaskan glaciers lost 41.9 ± 8.6 km3 yr−1 of water, and contributed 0.12 ± 0.02 mm yr−1 to sea-level rise, 34% less than estimated earlier. Reasons for our lower values include the higher spatial resolution of our glacier inventory as well as the reduction of ice thinning underneath debris and at the glacier margins, which were not resolved in earlier work. We suggest that estimates of mass loss from glaciers and ice caps in other mountain regions could be subject to similar revisions.},

abstract = {Simulation of areal snowmelt and snowcover depletion over time can be carried out by applying point-scale melt rate computations to distributions of snow water equivalent (SWE). In alpine basins, this can be done by considering these processes separately on individual slope units. However, differences in melt timing and rates arise at smaller spatial scales due to the variability in SWE and snowpack cold content, which affects the timing of melt initiation, depletion of the snowcover and spatial extent of the snowmelt runoff contributing area (SRCA). This study examined the effects of variability in SWE, internal energy and applied melt energy on melt rates and timing, and snowcover depletion in a small cold regions alpine basin over various scales ranging from point to basin. Melt rate computations were performed using a physically based energy balance snowmelt routine (Snobal) in the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) and compared with measurements at 3 meteorological stations over a ridge within the basin. At the point scale, a negative association between daily melt rates and SWE was observed in the early melt period, with deeper snow requiring greater energy inputs to initiate melt. SWE distributions over the basin (stratified by slope) were measured using snow surveys and repeat LiDAR depth estimates, and used together with computed melt rates to simulate the areal snowcover depletion. Comparison with observations from georeferenced oblique photographs showed an improvement in simulated areal snowcover depletion curves when accounting for the variability in melt rate with depth of SWE in the early melt period. Finally, the SRCA was characterized as the product of the snowcovered area and the fraction of the SWE distribution undergoing active melt and producing an appreciable runoff quantity on each slope unit. Results for each slope were then aggregated to give the basin scale SRCA. The SRCA is controlled by the variability of melt amongst slope units and over individual SWE distributions, the variability of SWE, and the resulting snowcover depletion patterns over the basin. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

In most of the lake sediment is 0 to 40. m thick, reaching a maximum of just over 100. m thick near the junction of the three arms. Cores from three locations in the lake provide evidence that the entire Holocene record is contained in the upper 4 to 6. m of the sedimentary record where rates of accumulation have been constant or have decreased slowly. The highest rates (0.35 to 0.72. mm/a) occur near points of inflow, while the lowest rate (0.22. mm/a) occurs in a sheltered environment with limited inflow, and significant hypolimnic circulation which may flush water and suspended sediment from the water column. Late Pleistocene sediment beneath has a similar acoustic signature to the cored Holocene record above, suggesting that the sedimentary processes governing its deposition were not greatly different than in the present lake but that extensive glacial and paraglacial sources contributed to a significantly higher rate of accumulation. Mazama ash analyzed from two locations near points of inflow has an age of 7576. ±. 60. cal. BP according to our chronology. Vivianite, which is uncommon in lakes of the Cordillera, occurs in the middle of the cores mainly associated with macroscopic wood fragments and indicates reducing conditions within the sediment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Two theoretical approaches to evaporation from saturated surfaces are outlined, the first being on an aerodynamic basis in which evaporation is regarded as due to turbulent transport of vapour by a process of eddy diffusion, and the second being on an energy basis in which evaporation is regarded as one of the ways of degrading incoming radiation. Neither approach is new, but a combination is suggested that eliminates the parameter measured with most difficulty-surface temperature-and provides for the first time an opportunity to make theoretical estimates of evaporation rates from standard meteorological data, estimates that can be retrospective. Experimental work to test these theories shows that the aerodynamic approach is not adequate and an empirical expression, previously obtained in America, is a better description of evaporation from open water. The energy balance is found to be quite successful. Evaporation rates from wet bare soil and from turf with an adequate supply of water are obtained as fractions of that from open water, the fraction for turf showing a seasonal change attributed to the annual cycle of length of daylight. Finally, the experimental results are applied to data published elsewhere and it is shown that a satisfactory account can be given of open water evaporation at four widely spaced sites in America and Europe, the results for bare soil receive a reasonable check in India, and application of the results for turf shows good agreement with estimates of evaporation from catchment areas in the British Isles.},

Visible lithostratigraphic variations, organic content/loss-on-ignition, calcium carbonate content, magnetic susceptibility and grain-size fractions (especially the fine silt) are used as proxy indicators of glacier presence and extent in the lake catchments. Following deglaciation, the early Holocene was characterized by generally small glaciers until a major advance (the Finse Event) peaking at approximately 8200cal. BP. From 7900 to at least 5300cal. BP glaciers appear to have been absent from central Jotunheimen. There is evidence of glacier expansion between about 2400 and 1600cal. BP (the B{\o}vertun I Event) and between about 1400 and 800cal.

abstract = {Drawing upon numerous field studies and modelling exercises of snow processes, the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) was developed to simulate the four season hydrological cycle in cold regions. CRHM includes modules describing radiative, turbulent and conductive energy exchanges to snow in open and forest environments, as well as account for losses from canopy snow sublimation and rain evaporation. Due to the physical-basis and rigorous testing of each module, there is a minimal need for model calibration. To evaluate CRHM, simulations of snow accumulation and melt were compared to observations collected at paired forest and clearing sites of varying latitude, elevation, forest cover density, and climate. Overall, results show that CRHM is capable of characterising the variation in snow accumulation between forest and clearing sites, achieving a model efficiency of 0.51 for simulations at individual sites. Simulations of canopy sublimation losses slightly overestimated observed losses from a weighed cut tree, having a model efficiency of 0.41 for daily losses. Good model performance was demonstrated in simulating energy fluxes to snow at the clearings, but results were degraded from this under forest cover due to errors in simulating sub-canopy net longwave radiation. However, expressed as cumulative energy to snow over the winter, simulated values were 96% and 98% of that observed at the forest and clearing sites, respectively. Overall, the good representation of the substantial variations in mass and energy between forest and clearing sites suggests that CRHM may be useful as an analytical or predictive tool for snow processes in needleleaf forest environments. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

For the earth's orbital elements, the proposed solution includes terms dependent to the second degree on disturbing masses, to third degree on planetary eccentricities and inclinations and, for the obliquity and the annual general precession in longitude, also to the second degree on earth's eccentricity. Improvements introduced by this solution upon the insolation computed through the Milankovitch series are deduced from the differences between Vernekar's results and present ones.

abstract = {Using precipitation and temperature data for the 20th century in combination with a macroscale hydrologic model, we evaluate changes in flood risk in the western U.S. associated both with century‐scale warming and interannual climate variations. In addition, we examine the implications of apparent increases in precipitation variability over the region since the mid‐1970s. We use detrended temperature data representing early and late 20th century climate to force the variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model and show that spatially homogeneous temperature changes over the western U.S. in the 20th century on the order of +1°C per century have resulted in substantial changes in flood risks over much of the region. Although changes specific to particular geographic areas are apparent in some cases, the overall changes due to observed warming trends are well categorized by midwinter temperature regimes in each watershed. Cold river basins where snow processes dominate the annual hydrologic cycle (<−6°C average in midwinter) typically show reductions in flood risk due to overall reductions in spring snowpack. Relatively warm rain‐dominant basins (>5°C average in midwinter) show little systematic change. Intermediate or transient basins show a wide range of effects depending on competing factors such as the relative role of antecedent snow and contributing basin area during storms that cause flooding. Warmer transient basins along the coast in Washington, Oregon, and California, in particular, tend to show increased flood risk. While the absolute value of simulated changes in flood risk is affected by basin scale, the nature of the relationship of flood risk to basin temperatures in midwinter is largely scale‐independent. Climate variations associated with Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also have strong effects on flood risks. In contrast to the effects associated with 20th century warming, the climate variability signal is characterized by regional scale patterns related to the geographic distribution of cool season precipitation also identified in many previous studies. In general, the largest changes in simulated flood risks are associated with years when PDO and ENSO are “in phase,” particularly in the southwest. Changes in the variability of cool season precipitation after about 1973, the causes of which are uncertain, are shown to result in increased flood risk over much of the western U.S. in the simulations.},

Intercepted snow is fractal and the irregularity of its shape depends on location in the canopy and age of the snow. The fractal shape of intercepted snow permits a relationship between snowcovered area in canopy photographs and interception load.

abstract = {The close relationship between air temperature measured at standard screen level and the rate of melt on snow and ice has been widely used to estimate the rate of melt. The parameterization of the melt rate using air temperature usually takes a simple form as a function of either the mean temperature for the relevant period or positive degree-day statistics. The computation provides the melt rate with sufficient accuracy for most practical purposes. Because of its simplicity, it is often called a crude method and is rated as inferior to other more sophisticated methods such as the energy balance method. The method is often used with the justification that temperature data are easily available or that obtaining energy balance fluxes is difficult. The physical process responsible for the temperature effect on the melt rate is often attributed to the sensible heat conduction from the atmosphere. The simulation capacity of the temperature-based melt-index method, however, is too good to be called crude and inferior. The author investigated physical processes that make the air temperature so effective a parameter for melt rate. Air temperature has a more profound influence on melt than previously has been acknowledged. The influence of air temperature through the turbulent sensible heat flux is limited, however. The air temperature information is transferred to the surface mainly through longwave atmospheric radiation, which is by far the most important heat source for melt. Under cloudless-sky conditions, as much as 60% of the atmospheric emission is derived from within the first 100 m and 90% from the first 1 km of the atmosphere. When the sky is overcast with the cloud bottom within the first 1 km, more than 90% originates within this layer between the surface and the bottom of the cloud. When the sky is overcast with the cloud bottom higher than 1 km, the first of the atmosphere still makes up about 70% of the longwave irradiance at the surface, for which the air temperature measured at standard screen level is the single most influential factor. Wind speed is only weakly correlated with melt rate, because the main energy source for melting is longwave atmospheric radiation, followed by the absorbed global radiation, both of which are independent of the movement of the atmosphere.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the effects of canopy physical processes on snow mass and energy balances in boreal ecosystems. We incorporate new parameterizations of radiation transfer through the vegetation canopy, interception of snow by the vegetation canopy, and under-canopy sensible heat transfer processes into the Versatile Integrator of Surface and Atmosphere (VISA) and test the model results against the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) data observed at South Study Area, Old Jack Pine. A modified two-stream radiation transfer scheme that accounts for the three-dimensional geometry of vegetation accurately simulates the transferring of solar radiation through the vegetation canopy when the leaf and stem area index is reduced to match the observed. VISA produces higher-than-observed surface albedo in wintertime. Implementation of a snow interception model that explicitly describes the loading and unloading of snow and the melting and refreezing of snow on the canopy into VISA reduces the fractional snow cover on the canopy and the surface albedo. VISA overestimates the downward sensible heat fluxes from the canopy to the snow surface, which leads to earlier snow ablation and a shallower snowpack than the observed. Explicitly including a canopy heat storage term in the canopy energy balance equation decreases the spuriously large amplitude of the diurnal canopy temperature variation and reduces the excessive daytime sensible heat flux from the canopy downward to the snow surface. Sensitivity tests reveal that the turbulent sensible heat flux below the vegetation canopy strongly depends on the canopy absorption coefficient of momentum. During spring the daytime temperature difference between the snow surface and the vegetation canopy forms a strongly stable atmospheric condition, which results in a larger absorption coefficient of momentum and a weak turbulent sensible heat flux. The modeled excessive downward sensible heat flux from the vegetation canopy to the snow surface is considerably reduced through the stability correction to the canopy absorption coefficient of momentum.

abstract = {The snow surface temperature (SST) is essential for estimating longwave radiation fluxes from snow. SST can be diagnosed using finescale multilayer snow physics models that track changes in snow properties and internal energy; however, these models are heavily parameterized, have high predictive uncertainty, and require continuous simulation to estimate prognostic state variables. Here, a relatively simple model to estimate SST that is not reliant on prognostic state variables is proposed. The model assumes that the snow surface is poorly connected thermally to the underlying snowpack and largely transparent for most of the shortwave radiation spectrum, such that a snow surface energy balance among only sensible heat, latent heat, longwave radiation, and near-infrared radiation is possible and is called the radiative psychrometric model (RPM). The RPM SST is sensitive to air temperature, humidity, ventilation, and longwave irradiance and is secondarily affected by absorption of near-infrared radiation at the snow surface that was higher where atmospheric deposition of particulates was more likely to be higher. The model was implemented with neutral stability, an implicit windless exchange coefficient, and constant shortwave absorption factors and aerodynamic roughness lengths. It was evaluated against radiative SST measurements from the Canadian Prairies and Rocky Mountains, French Alps, and Bolivian Andes. With optimized and global shortwave absorption and aerodynamic roughness length parameters, the model is shown to accurately predict SST under a wide range of conditions, providing superior predictions when compared to air temperature, dewpoint, or ice bulb calculation approaches.},

The automated gauges tested were the Geonor T-200B and Campbell Scientific Canada TE525 Tipping Bucket gauge with CS705 snow fall adaptor. Both gauges were equipped with Alter-shields and compared to a Nipher reference gauge to estimate gauge catch efficiency. The Nipher was calibrated to 'true' snowfall by WMO standard equations. During the snowfall periods a variety of storm sizes was observed, with all wind speeds less than 7 m s-1. The results provided a mean calculated snowfall catch efficiency on an event basis (gauge to true) of 0.60 for the Geonor with Alter shield, and 0.40 for the Tipping Bucket with Alter-shield.. Cumulative seasonal efficiencies were higher, being 0.78 for the Geonor and 0.66 for the and the Tipping Bucket gauge. A relationship between catch efficiency and wind speed was developed for the Geonor.},

abstract = {Compared to lower-gradient channels, steep mountain streams typically have rougher beds and shallower flow depths, making macro-scale flow resistance (due to, e.g., immobile boulders and irregular bedforms) more important as controls on sediment transport. The marked differences in hydraulics, flow resistance, and grain mobility between steep and lower-gradient streams raise the question of whether the same equations can predict bed load transport rates across wide ranges of channel gradients. We studied a steep, glacier-fed mountain stream (Riedbach, Ct. Valais, Switzerland) that provides a natural experiment for exploring how stream gradients affect bed load transport rates. The streambed gradient increases over a 1 km stream reach by roughly one order of magnitude (from 3% to 38%), while flow discharge and width remain approximately constant. Sediment transport rates were determined in the 3% reach using Bunte bed load traps and in the 38% reach using the Swiss plate geophone system. Despite a ten-fold increase in bed gradient, bed load transport rates did not increase substantially. Observed transport rates for these two very different bed gradients could be predicted reasonably well by using a flow resistance partitioning approach to account for increasing bed roughness (D 84 changes from 0.17 m to 0.91 m) within a fractional bed load transport equation. This suggests that sediment transport behavior across this large range of steep slopes agrees with patterns established in previous studies for both lower-gradient and steep reaches, and confirms the applicability of the flow resistance and bed load transport equations at very steep slopes.},

abstract = {Annually laminated sediments were recovered from Green Lake, a proglacial lake in the southern Coast Mountains in British Columbia, to examine their potential as a temperature proxy. Varve thickness is moderately correlated with temperature anomalies (A.D. 1900-1994) and annual maximum mean daily discharge of Lillooet River (A.D. 1930-1999), but these relations are not stable through time. Following A.D. 1977, the relation between varve thickness and annual maximum mean daily discharge is stronger. Prior to A.D. 1977, varve thickness is correlated with March to October air temperature, which controls the intensity and duration of glacier runoff. Varve thickness is weakly correlated with reconstructed air temperature records for North America and the Northern Hemisphere for the period A.D. 1600-1976. Less extensive glacier cover may explain the lack of a clear temperature signal in the varved sediment record prior to A.D. 1600 and following A.D. 1977. The period of highest lake sedimentation, from A.D. 1920 to 1945, coincides with rapid retreat of glaciers in the watershed. The lack of a similar level of sedimentation in the varve chronology suggests that glacier recession during the period 1920-1945 was higher than at any time in the past 600 years.},

abstract = {Sediment cores from three proglacial lakes in northern Banff National Park, Alberta, preserve a record of Holocene glacial activity upvalley which is more continuous and better dated than available surficial records. Dating of the cores is based on tephrochronology and 16 AMS14C ages of terrestrial macrofossils. All cores contain a threefold sequence of lacustrine sediments overlying a late Pleistocene diamicton. Basal lacustrine sediments > 10,10014C yr old contain little organic matter. Sediment composition indicates a large glacigenic contribution. A sharp increase in organic content marks the beginning of the Altithermal interval at all three lakes. This transition occurred abruptly at about 10,10014C yr B.P. at Crowfoot Lake and possibly more gradually at the other lakes. Altithermal sediments contain relatively little glacigenic material, and during most of the Altithermal, glaciers may have been absent above Crowfoot and Bow Lakes. Glaciers draining into Hector Lake appear to have persisted through the Altithermal. A subsequent decrease in organic content in each lake, reflecting increased clastic sedimentation, marks the end of the Altithermal and the onset of Neoglacial ice advances. The transition took place between about 5800 and 400014C yr B.P. and may be time-transgressive, beginning earlier in Hector Lake than in Crowfoot Lake. Changing Neoglacial clastic sedimentation rates through the Neoglacial interval indicate two main periods of increased glacier extent, between ca. 3000 and 1800 varve yr ago (ca. 2900-190014C yr B.P.) and during the last several hundred years. During the intervening period glaciers were less extensive, but much more extensive than during the recessions of the Altithermal interval.},

abstract = {Water losses from snow intercepted by forest canopy can significantly influence the hydrological cycle in seasonally snow-covered regions, yet how snow interception losses (SIL) are influenced by a changing climate are poorly understood. In this study, we used a unique 30 year record (1986–2015) of snow accumulation and snow water equivalent measurements in a mature mixed coniferous (Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris) forest stand and an adjacent open area to assess how changes in weather conditions influence SIL. Given little change in canopy cover during this study, the 20% increase in SIL was likely the result of changes in winter weather conditions. However, there was no significant change in average wintertime precipitation and temperature during the study period. Instead, mean monthly temperature values increased during the early winter months (i.e., November and December), whereas there was a significant decrease in precipitation in March. We also assessed how daily variation in meteorological variables influenced SIL and found that about 50% of the variation in SIL was correlated to the amount of precipitation that occurred when temperatures were lower than −3 °C and to the proportion of days with mean daily temperatures higher than +0.4 °C. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of understanding the appropriate time scale and thresholds in which weather conditions influence SIL in order to better predict how projected climate change will influence snow accumulation and hydrology in boreal forests in the future.},

abstract = {A finescale model of blowing snow is used to simulate the characteristics of snow cover in a low-Arctic catchment with moderate topography and partial shrub cover. The influence of changing shrub characteristics is investigated by performing a sequence of simulations with varying shrub heights and coverage. Increasing shrub height gives an increase in snow depth within the shrub-covered areas, up to a limit determined by the supply of falling and blowing snow, but increasing shrub coverage gives a decrease in snow depths within shrubs as the supply of blowing snow imported from open areas is reduced. A simulation of snow redistribution over the existing topography without any shrub cover gives much greater accumulations of snow on slopes in the lee of the prevailing wind than on windward slopes; in contrast, shrubs are able to trap snow on both lee and windward slopes. A spatially aggregated, or tiled, model is developed in which snow is relocated by wind transport from sparsely vegetated tiles to more densely vegetated tiles. The vegetation distribution is not specified, but the simulation is parameterized using average fetch lengths along the major transport axis. The aggregated model is found to be capable of matching the average snow accumulation in shrub and open areas predicted by the distributed model reasonably well but with much less computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Snowmelt from forested, mountainous environments in the western United States is a critical regional water resource for streamflow and ecological productivity. These landscapes are undergoing rapid changes from the combined effects of forest fires, insect infestation and climate change. Numerous observational studies demonstrate that trees control snowpack accumulation and ablation over scales of tens of metres. Representing forest heterogeneity in models is important for understanding how changes in climate and vegetation cover affect the snowpack; yet, many snow models simplify a forest into two categories: canopy covered and non-canopy covered. We combine existing parameterizations of mass and energy fluxes within a new three-dimensional framework informed by Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (ALSM)-derived canopy maps and evaluated with ALSM-derived snow depth maps to explicitly simulate snow cover in relation to heterogeneous canopy. Model results capture much of the observed snow variability depicted in the 1-m ALSM-derived snow depth maps. Observations and modelled results identify open areas <15m from tree canopies as having more snow and more snow variability than areas >15m from tree canopies, and modelled results predict that open areas <15m from tree canopies have 30-40% more net snow water input than areas that are underneath tree canopies and 10-25% more net snow water input than areas that are >15m from tree canopies. Furthermore, 1-m simulations give higher estimates for net snow water input than coarser resolution simulations, mainly in areas with fewer trees. These results suggest the importance of explicitly representing canopy edges in snow models. Copyright},

abstract = {The aim was to investigate the impacts of trampling on water loss and partitioning in vegetation with contrasting structure and species composition. A new design of weighing lysimeter was used in glasshouse experiments to compare evapotranspiration from intact and trampled blocks of vegetation. The lysimeter system was able to detect differences between treatments after only a few hours. Evapotranspiration was recorded for six communities, representative of cryptogam - vascular plant communities found in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland. Vegetation blocks of Racomitrium and Vaccinium/Hylocomium heath communities had the greatest cumulative evapotranspiration and lichen heath the least over 48 h. Blocks from three of the communities (Agrostis/Festuca grassland, Calluna wet heath, and lichen heath) were used in a trampling experiment with five levels of damage. Trampling progressively destroyed the structure of the vegetation of all communities and increased the rates of water loss from the blocks. The grassland community vegetation was the most resilient. These results help to link the massive changes in vegetation structure resulting from trampling to effects on water loss and microclimate.},

abstract = {Forests reduce snow accumulation on the ground through canopy interception and subsequent evaporative losses. To understand snow interception and associated hydrological processes, studies have typically relied on resource-intensive point scale measurements derived from weighed trees or indirect measurements that compared snow accumulation between forested sites and nearby clearings. Weighed trees are limited to small or medium-sized trees, and indirect comparisons can be confounded by wind redistribution of snow, branch unloading, and clearing size. A potential alternative method could use terrestrial lidar (light detection and ranging) because three-dimensional lidar point clouds can be generated for any size tree and can be utilized to calculate volume of the intercepted snow. The primary objective of this study was to provide a feasibility assessment for estimating snow interception volume with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), providing information on challenges and opportunities for future research. During the winters of 2017 and 2018, intercepted snow masses were continuously measured for two model trees suspended from load-cells. Simultaneously, autonomous terrestrial lidar scanning (ATLS) was used to develop volumetric estimates of intercepted snow. Multiplying ATLS volume estimates by snow density estimates (derived from empirical models based on air temperature) enabled the comparison of predicted vs. measured snow mass. Results indicate agreement between predicted and measured values (R2 ≥ 0.69, RMSE ≥ 0.91 kg, slope ≥ 0.97, intercept ≥ -1.39) when multiplying TLS snow interception volume with a constant snow density estimate. These results suggest that TLS might be a viable alternative to traditional approaches for mapping snow interception, potentially useful for estimating snow loads on large trees, collecting data in difficult to access terrain, and calibrating snow interception models to new forest types around the globe.},

Moose Lake (13.9 km2), situated at 1032 m a.s.l., contains a partially varved record indicating variable rates of accumulation during the last millennium that, in general, coincide with previously documented LIA glacial advances in the region and locally. Dendrochronological assessment of forefield surfaces in the headwaters of the catchment (Reef Icefield) shows that periods of moraine construction occurred just prior to ad 1770, ad 1839 and ad 1883, and some time before ad 1570. Taken collectively, increases in varve thickness within eight Moose Lake sediment cores coincide with documented glacier advances over the twelfth through fourteenth centuries, the eighteenth century, and nineteenth through twentieth centuries. Glacial activity during the sixteenth century is also indicated. While varve thickness variations in proximal and distal sediments clearly reflect glacial activity upstream of Moose Lake, the intermediate varve record is relatively insensitive to these decadal and longer-term catchment processes. Variations in Ca and related elements derived from glaciated carbonate terrain within the Moose River sub-catchment (including Reef Icefield) indicate gradually increasing delivery from these sources from the twelfth through twentieth centuries even where the varve thickness record is unresponsive.

abstract = {Snowmelt is the principal source for soil moisture, ground-water re-charge, and stream-flow in mountainous regions of the western US, Canada, and other similar regions of the world. Information on the timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or changing climate conditions is required for successful water and resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model ISNOBAL is used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km2, with simulation periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and watershed management.},

abstract = {Lillooet River drains 3850 km2of partly glacier-covered terrain before entering Lillooet Lake in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia. The elongated lake covers an area of 21 km2and forms a deep basin with water depths to 137 m. Acoustic profiling of the subbottom and sampling of the surface sediments reveals that total sediment thickness varies from 30 + m in the north half of the lake near Lillooet delta and then declines to less than 16 m in the south. Up-valley ice retreat approximately 11 000 years BP resulted in conformable sediments in the main lake indicative of turbidity currents off Lillooet delta which infilled and flattened the underlying surface. A sill which separates the main and south basins prevents the down-lake progression of turbidity currents resulting in conformable deposits indicative of rain-out (i.e. settling) processes only. A major acoustic reflector at about 6-9 m below the modern sediment surface is associated with a well-dated volcanic eruption and sediment yield event in the upper basin at 2400 years BP. Modern glaciolacustrine deposition forms varves which accumulate at a rate of up to 28 mm year-1in the north and decline to less than 0.9 mm year-1in the south. The occurrence of two sediment-runoff regimes, one average and the other extreme leads to distinct differences in varve sedimentology and varve thickness. De-coupling the two signals using sedimentary evidence alone cannot be done consistently so a sediment yield-runoff relation for the lake (r2= 41%) contains considerable 'noise'. An annual sediment accumulation chronology covering the last 125 years shows a much higher frequency of 'extreme' runoff-sediment yield events during the post-1940 interval. This parallels a documented change in climate of the region after 1945 and suggests that a longer varve chronology would provide a good, high-resolution, proxy record of hydroclimatic variations. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {This study presents an analysis of snow distribution heterogeneity and the factors affecting this variability. The analysis focuses on manually sampled data from 21 snow surveys covering 11 years at the drift-dominated Reynolds Mountain East catchment (0.36 km2) in southwestern Idaho, USA. Surveys were conducted midwinter and in early spring. Interseason and intraseason trends were examined along with the time stability of distributions, goodness-of-fit to theoretical distributions, and the representativeness of an index site as a measure of basin-wide snow water equivalent. The average snow depth coefficient of variation (CV) over the entire time period was 0.71, which is in accordance with broad regional assessments. Higher wind speeds during snow events and increased melt led to increased heterogeneity and higher CVs. Forested sites produced lower CVs presumably due to moderated winds at these sites. Consistent wind directions produced accumulation patterns that were very stable from year-to-year. Many previous studies have suggested that vital subgrid snow heterogeneity in large-scale models can be approximated with parametric distributions. Gamma distributions were preferred over lognormal distributions in describing the overall distribution while in tree-covered regions with less variability there was little difference between the two. It was also found that an index site, akin to the majority of North American mountain weather observation stations, provided a reasonable approximation of catchment-averaged SWE in most years. However, the reliability of this measure decreased in years that deviated from normal patterns.

abstract = {Air temperature (Tair) plays an important role in determining how a canopy intercepts snow and apart from event size is the single most important micrometeorological variable found to adequately influence interception rates and magnitude. We present results from a 6-year study on snow-forest interactions. This data set reveals the central role Tair plays in how a forest intercepts snow and the need to effectively incorporate this within snow process models. Warm temperature events show a higher canopy interception efficiency (CIE) for all sites across the study period, while colder Tair events demonstrated a lower corresponding CIE. Additionally, there is a structural component of the forest itself that plays a role in the ability of canopy to intercept snow. Recognizing the physical vertical structure of a forest as nontrivial, we present a simple canopy interception model that includes a novel three-dimensional forest metric that captures canopy complexity, Gz, combined with event size and Tair to adequately predict event-based interception. Low complexity forests decrease interception capacity from the outset, whereas a highly complex or diverse forest increases interception potential and leads to a nonlinear increase in temperature-based canopy interception due to more surface area able to intercept falling snow. Essentially, forest structure sets the boundary condition of the potential to intercept, while event size and Tair determines the rate or amount of interception. We develop a simple canopy snow interception model from these data and compare modeled output against three commonly used interception models in both a maritime and continental snow climate. Partitioning the relative importance of snow-forest interactions on canopy interception will help provide the information to accurately model snow-forest interactions and also aid in our water resources predictive capabilities now and into the future.},

abstract = {Snow-covered complex terrain is an extremely important runoff-generating landscape in high-altitude and high-latitude environments, yet it is often considered nonviable for eddy covariance measurements of turbulent fluxes. Turbulent flux data are useful for evaluating the coupled snow cover mass and energy balance that control snow ablation and melt. In particular, detailed, multiseason analyses of eddy covariance data postprocessing requirements and resulting data quality for hydrological analyses in open and sheltered mountain sites have not been conducted. These analyses are needed since these landscapes typify those that generate snowmelt runoff in the mountain west of North America. Eddy covariance measurements taken from exposed hilltop and sheltered subcanopy snow research sites during three snow seasons underwent rigorous postprocessing and data quality assessments. Procedures included data filtering, air density corrections, sensor heating, axis rotation, and exclusion of nonstationary data. Data quality analysis showed that 77% of the sensible heat flux data and 95% of the latent heat flux data were of high quality. There was little interannual variability over three seasons in quality or improvements due to postprocessing results. A comparison of summary data based on a 30-min averaging period to postprocessed high-resolution flux data found that the postprocessed sensible heat fluxes were up to 14% less than the summary fluxes for the snow season. The results indicated that application of unattended eddy covariance techniques at these sites was viable, but the full suite of corrections and postprocessing are advisable to obtain flux observations of sufficient reliability for snow hydrology calculations.},

abstract = {Abstract In June 2013, excessive rainfall associated with an intense weather system triggered severe flooding in southern Alberta, which became the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history. This article provides an overview of the climatological aspects and large-scale hydrometeorological features associated with the flooding event based upon information from a variety of sources, including satellite data, upper air soundings, surface observations and operational model analyses. The results show that multiple factors combined to create this unusually severe event. The event was characterized by a slow-moving upper level low pressure system west of Alberta, blocked by an upper level ridge, while an associated well-organized surface low pressure system kept southern Alberta, especially the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, in continuous precipitation for up to two days. Results from air parcel trajectory analysis show that a significant amount of the moisture originated from the central Great Plains, transported into Alberta by a southeasterly low level jet. The event was first dominated by significant thunderstorm activity, and then evolved into continuous precipitation supported by the synoptic-scale low pressure system. Both the thunderstorm activity and upslope winds associated with the low pressure system produced large rainfall amounts. A comparison with previous similar events occurring in the same region suggests that the synoptic-scale features associated with the 2013 rainfall event were not particularly intense; however, its storm environment was the most convectively unstable. The system also exhibited a relatively high freezing level, which resulted in rain, rather than snow, mainly falling over the still snow-covered mountainous areas. Melting associated with this rain-on-snow scenario likely contributed to downstream flooding. Furthermore, above-normal snowfall in the preceding spring helped to maintain snow in the high-elevation areas, which facilitated the rain-on-snow event.

abstract = {Abstract  This paper presents a multi-proxy climate record of an 11 m long core collected in Lago Puyehue (southern Chile, 40°S) and extending back to 18,000 cal yr BP. The multi-proxy analyses include sedimentology, mineralogy, grain size, geochemistry, loss-on-ignition, magnetic susceptibility and radiocarbon dating. Results demonstrate that sediment grain size is positively correlated with the biogenic sediment content and can be used as a proxy for lake paleoproductivity. On the other hand, the magnetic susceptibility signal is correlated with the aluminium and titanium concentrations and can be used as a proxy for the terrigenous supply. Temporal variations of sediment composition evidence that, since the Last Glacial Maximum, the Chilean Lake District was characterized by three abrupt climate changes superimposed on a long-term climate evolution. These rapid climate changes are: (1) an abrupt warming at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum at 17,300 cal yr BP; (2) a 13,100–12,300 cal yr BP cold event, ending rapidly and interpreted as the local counterpart of the Younger Dryas cold period, and (3) a 3,400–2,900 cal yr BP climatic instability synchronous with a period of low solar activity. The timing of the 13,100–12,300 cold event is compared with similar records in both hemispheres and demonstrates that this southern hemisphere climate change precedes the northern hemisphere Younger Dryas cold period by 500 to 1,000 years.},

abstract = {Seven temperature-based equations, each representing a typical form, were evaluated and compared for determining evaporation at two climatological stations (Rawson Lake and Atikokan) in north-western Ontario, Canada. The comparison was first made using the original constant values involved in each equation, and then using the recalibrated constant values. The results show that when the original constant values were used, larger biases existed for most of the equations for both stations. When recalibrated constant values were substituted for the original constant values, six of the seven equations improved for both stations. Using locally calibrated parameter values, all seven equations worked well for determining mean seasonal evaporation values. For monthly evaporation values, the modified Blaney-Criddle method produced least error for all months for both stations, followed by the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods. The Linacre, Kharrufa and Hamon methods showed a significant bias in September for both stations. With properly determined constant values, the modified Blaney-Criddle, the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods can be recommended for estimating evaporation in the study region, as far as temperature-based methods are concerned.

abstract = {Snow cover fraction (SCF) has a significant influence on the surface albedo and thus on the radiation balance and surface climate. Long-term three dimensional simulations with general circulation models (GCMs) show that the SCF greatly affects the climate in the Northern Hemisphere. By means of both ground observations and remotely sensed data, several deficiencies in the SCF simulated by the current ECHAM4 GCM were identified over mountainous ares a substantial overestimation in the SCF was found whereas flat areas showed a distinctly under-estimated SCF. This work proposes a new parametrization of the SCF for use in GCMs. Evaluations illustrate that it is beneficial to distinguish between the following three terrains: (1) flat, non-forested areas, (2) mountainous regions and (3) forests. The modified SCF parametrization for flat, non-forested areas was derived by using global datasets of ground-based snow depth and remote sensing observations of snow cover data. A 3-dimensional ECHAM4 simulation showed that this modification raises the SCF by up to approximately 20%, mainly in areas with a relatively thin snow cover. The comparison between remotely sensed and simulated mean monthly surface albedo revealed a significant overestimation of the surface albedo in snow-covered mountainous areas. An extension of the current SCF parametrization in ECHAM4 to take into account mountain effects, based on the French climate model Arp{\`{e}}ge, yielded a close agreement with satellite-derived surface albedo. The adoption of the submodel for snow albedo, as used in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), combined with a newly developed simple snow interception model, demonstrated the ability to capture the main physical processes of snow-covered canopies, including the albedo. The validation of the new parametrization with Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) field data showed that the modification is appropriate to capture the main features of the albedo over snow-covered forests during and after heavy snowfall events. Furthermore, the proposed modification has a beneficial impact on the delayed snow melt in spring, a well-known problem in many current GCMs: The simulated surface albedo over the boreal forests decreases by approximately 0.1 during winter and spring, which is in better agreement with ground-based observations. This induces a significant rise in the surface temperature over extended parts of Eurasia and North America in late spring, which subsequently yields a faster snowmelt and an accelerated retreat of the snow line.},

abstract = {The extreme sediment delivery regime of a montane catchment was examined through the analysis of recent lacustrine varve deposits recovered from a high-density sampling program. Years of anomalously high sediment yield from the Green Lake watershed were identified over a 70-year period (1930-2000) based on whole-lake varve deposit volumes. Intra-annual sediment delivery events were categorized and described for those anomalous years using historical hydroclimatic data and the stratigraphic record observed within inflow proximal sediment cores. Extreme sediment delivery coincided with high discharge conditions and elevated sediment availability resulting from (1) rapid glacier recession of the early twentieth century, (2) late-summer and autumn rainstorm-generated floods, and (3) freshet floods caused by unusual snowmelt conditions. The thickness and physical characteristics of varves vary among years that experienced different types of moderate and extreme sediment delivery events in relation to the defined average-regime depositional model. Several hydroclimatic factors can interact to produce composite varve units of anomalous thickness. In some cases, geomorphic events, such as landslides and channel changes, contributed to extreme sediment delivery in the Green Lake catchment. The interaction of these geomorphic effects, coupled with the variable nature of associated hydroclimatic functions, complicate paleoenvironmental assessments based on the lacustrine varve record. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {Hydrological processes over and through frozen and unfrozen ground were simulated in the well instrumented boreal forest basin of White Gull Creek, Saskatchewan, Canada using a model created using the flexible Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform. The CRHM-created Boreal Hydrology Model was structured and initially parameterized using decades of process hydrology research in the southern boreal forest with minor parameter calibration, and generally produced quite good performance on simultaneously reproducing the measurements of runoff, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil liquid water content and eddy correlation flux tower observations of evapotranspiration (ET) over two decades. To examine the sensitivity of basin hydrology to perturbed climate inputs, air temperature (T) inputs were set up by linear increments in the reference observation of up to +6 ℃, and precipitation (P) inputs were generated by multiplying the reference observed P from 70% to 130%. The model results showed that the basin hydrological variables showed quite different sensitivities to perturbations of P and T. The volume of annual runoff and the annual runoff coefficient increased more rapidly with rising P, at rates of 31% and 16% per 10% increase in P, but decreased by only 3.8% and 4.7% per 1 ℃ of warming. Annual ET increased rapidly with temperature, by 7% per 1 ℃ of warming and therefore drove the streamflow volumetric changes with warming, but increased only 1% per 10% increase in P. Perturbations of P and T had distinctively different influences on the streamflow regime. Increased P enhanced the intra- and inter-annual variabilities of basin runoff, reduced the relative contribution of winter runoff to annual runoff and increased the relative contribution of summer runoff; whilst rising T resulted in the inverse changes in the streamflow regime. Effects of warming on some hydrological processes could be compensated for to varying degrees by the effects of increases in P. Reductions in the annual runoff volume and runoff coefficient caused by warming up to 6 ℃ could be compensated for by increases of <20% in P. However, the maximum increase in P (+30%) examined could only compensate for the changes in snow processes caused by warming of less than 4 ℃ and snow-cover duration decreases with 1 ℃ warming could not be compensated for by any precipitation increase considered. These results inform the vulnerability of boreal forest hydrology to the first-order changes in P and T and provide guidance for further climate impact assessments for hydrology in the southern boreal forest in Canada.},

abstract = {Forests modify snow processes and affect snow water storage as well as snow disappearance timing. However, forest influences on snow accumulation and ablation vary with climate and topography and are therefore subject to temporal and spatial variability. We utilize multiple years of snow observations from across the Pacific Northwest, United States, to assess forest–snow interactions in the relatively warm winter conditions characteristic of maritime and transitional maritime–continental climates. We (a) quantify the difference in snow magnitude and disappearance timing between forests and open areas and (b) assess how forest modifications of snow accumulation and ablation combine to determine whether snow disappears later in the forest or in the open. We find that snow disappearance timing at 12 (out of 14) sites ranges from synchronous in the forest and open to snow persisting up to 13 weeks longer in the open relative to a forested area. By analyzing accumulation and ablation rates up to the day when snow first disappears from the forest, we find that the difference between accumulation rates in the open and forest is larger than the difference between ablation rates. Thus, canopy snow interception and subsequent loss, rather than ablation, set up longer snow duration in the open. However, at two relatively windy sites (hourly average wind speeds up to 8 and 17 m/s), differential snow disappearance timing is reversed: Snow persists 2–5 weeks longer in the forest. At the windiest sites, accumulation rates in the forest and open are similar. Ablation rates are higher in the open, but the difference between ablation rates in the forest and open at these sites is approximately equivalent to the difference at less windy sites. Thus, longer snow retention in the forest at the windiest sites is controlled by depositional differences rather than by reduced ablation rates. These findings suggest that improved quantification of forest effects on snow accumulation processes is needed to accurately predict the effect of forest management or natural disturbance on snow water resources.},

abstract = {After a programme of integrated field and modelling research, hydrological processes of considerable uncertainty such as snow redistribution by wind, snow interception, sublimation, snowmelt, infiltration into frozen soils, hillslope water movement over permafrost, actual evaporation, and radiation exchange to complex surfaces have been described using physically based algorithms. The cold regions hydrological model (CRHM) platform, a flexible object‐oriented modelling system was devised to incorporate these algorithms and others and to connect them for purposes of simulating the cold regions hydrological cycle over small to medium sized basins. Landscape elements in CRHM can be linked episodically in process‐specific cascades via blowing snow transport, overland flow, organic layer subsurface flow, mineral interflow, groundwater flow, and streamflow. CRHM has a simple user interface but no provision for calibration; parameters and model structure are selected based on the understanding of the hydrological system; as such the model can be used both for prediction and for diagnosis of the adequacy of hydrological understanding. The model is described and demonstrated in basins from the semi‐arid prairie to boreal forest, mountain and muskeg regions of Canada where traditional hydrological models have great difficulty in describing hydrological phenomena. Some success is shown in simulating various elements of the hydrological cycle without calibration; this is encouraging for predicting hydrology in ungauged basins.

It displays graphically and processes statistically, ET0 values calculated from full and incomplete weather data sets. The program is written in Delphi with a Paradox database and includes a comprehensive, context-sensitive help file. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for three locations as examples. The error in predicting ET0 using estimated weather parameters was reduced by using 5-day averages of ET0 rather than daily values.

abstract = {Wind redistribution, radiation and turbulent heat fluxes determine seasonal snow accumulation and melt patterns in alpine environments. Mathematical representations of windflow vary in complexity and introduce uncertainty to snow modelling. To characterize this uncertainty, a spatially distributed snow model that considers the physics of blowing snow transport and sublimation and the energy fluxes contributing to snowpack ablation were evaluated for its ability to simulate seasonal snow patterns around a windy alpine ridge in the Canadian Rockies. The model was forced with output from three windflow models of varying computational complexity and physical realism: (i) a terrain-based empirical interpolation of station observations, (ii) a simple turbulence model and (iii) a computational fluid dynamics model. Compared with wind measurements, the windflow simulations produced similar and relatively accurate (biases lower than ±1.1ms<sup>-1</sup>) wind speed estimates. However, the snow mass budget simulated by the snow model was highly sensitive to the windflow simulation used. Compared with measurements, distributed snow model depth and water equivalent errors were smallest using either of the two turbulence models, with the best representation of downwind drifts by the computational fluid dynamics model. Sublimation was an important mass loss from the ridge, and windflow model choice resulted in cumulative seasonal sublimation differences ranging from 10.5% to 19.0% of seasonal snowfall. When aggregated to larger scales, differences in cumulative snowmelt and snow transport were negligible, but persistent differences in sublimation and snow-covered area suggest that windflow model choice can have significant implications at multiple scales. Uncertainty can be reduced by using physically based windflow models to drive distributed snow models.},

abstract = {Sediments in eight glacier-fed lakes of the southern Canadian cordillera have been investigated using surface coring and subbottom acoustical surveys. Laminated or varved sediments are used to construct accumulation chronologies which reflect both average and extreme depositional regimes. Average departures in varve thickness are associated with variations in spring runoff controlled by winter precipitation, summer temperature and glacier melting. Extreme depar-tures reflect a broader range of controls such as outburst floods, autumn storms and slumps or slides directly into the lake. Discrimination between extreme and average regimes is possible using sedimentary evidence, which includes grain size, structure and spatial continuity of the deposits, allowing for inferences about the origin of events in the pre-instrument record. An average of 4-6 extreme events per 100 years appears to be common in these lakes; however, their low frequency suggests sediment delivery is dominated by the average regime. Reconstructions of specific sediment yield are in the range of 30-450 t km" 2 year" 1 averaged over the last 140 years.

abstract = {Thirty-three snowpack models of varying complexity and purpose were evaluated across a wide range of hydrometeorological and forest canopy conditions at five Northern Hemisphere locations, for up to two winter snow seasons. Modeled estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) or depth were compared to observations at forest and open sites at each location. Precipitation phase and duration of above-freezing air temperatures are shown to be major influences on divergence and convergence of modeled estimates of the subcanopy snowpack: When models are considered collectively at all locations, comparisons with observations show that it is harder to model SWE at forested sites than open sites. There is no universal "best" model for all sites or locations, but comparison of the consistency of individual model performances relative to one another at different sites shows that there is less consistency at forest sites than open sites, and even less consistency between forest and open sites in the same year. A good performance by a model at a forest site is therefore unlikely to mean a good model performance by the same model at an open site (and vice versa). Calibration of models at forest sites provides lower errors than uncalibrated models at three out of four locations. However, benefits of calibration do not ' translate to subsequent years, and benefits gained by models calibrated for forest snow processes are not translated to open conditions.

abstract = {The June 2013 flood in the Canadian Rockies featured rain-on-snow (ROS) runoff generation at alpine elevations that contributed to the high streamflows observed during the event. Such a mid-summer ROS event has not been diagnosed in detail, and a diagnosis may help to understand future high discharge-producing hydrometeorological events in mountainous cold regions. The alpine hydrology of the flood was simulated using a physically based model created with the modular cold regions hydrological modelling platform. The event was distinctive in that, although at first, relatively warm rain fell onto existing snowdrifts inducing ROS melt; the rainfall turned to snowfall as the air mass cooled and so increased snowcover and snowpacks in alpine regions, which then melted rapidly from ground heat fluxes in the latter part of the event. Melt rates of existing snowpacks were substantially lower during the ROS than during the relatively sunny periods preceding and following the event as a result of low wind speeds, cloud cover and cool temperatures. However, at the basin scale, melt volumes increased during the event as a result of increased snowcover from the fresh snowfall and consequent large ground heat contributions to melt energy, causing snowmelt to enhance rainfall–runoff by one fifth. Flow pathways also shifted during the event from relatively slow sub-surface flow prior to the flood to an even contribution from sub-surface and fast overland flow during and immediately after the event. This early summer, high precipitation ROS event was distinctive for the impact of decreased solar irradiance in suppressing melt rates, the contribution of ground heat flux to basin scale snowmelt after precipitation turned to snowfall, the transition from slow sub-surface to fast overland flow runoff as the sub-surface storage saturated and streamflow volumes that exceeded precipitation. These distinctions show that summer, mountain ROS events should be considered quite distinct from winter ROS and can be important contributors to catastrophic events.

Compared to measurements, both a one-dimensional (1D) energy-balance model and a two-dimensional (2D) radial trunk heat transfer model that simulated trunk surface temperatures and thermal inertia performed well (RMSE and biases better than 1.7° and ±0.4°C). The 2D model that resolved a thin bark layer better simulated daytime temperature spikes. Measurements and models agreed that trunk surfaces returned to ambient air temperature values near sunset. Canopy needle temperatures modeled with a 1D energy-balance approach were within the range of measurements. The radiative transfer model simulated substantial tree-contributed snow surface longwave irradiance to a distance of approximately one-half the tree height, with higher values on the sun-exposed sides of the tree. Trunks had very localized and substantially lower longwave energy influence on snowmelt compared to that of the canopy. The temperature and radiative transfer models provide the spatially detailed information needed to develop scaling relationships for estimating net radiation for snowmelt in sparse and discontinuous forest canopies.},

abstract = {Accumulation of snow under forest canopies is known to decline with increasing canopy density and leaf area because of snow interception and sublimation in the canopy. Seasonal snow accumulation measurements, collected over a decade from various forest stands in western Canada, were used to test and develop methods to relate forest snow accumulation to stand properties and observations of either small-clearing seasonal snow accumulation or seasonal snowfall. At sub-stand scales, the variability of seasonal snow accumulation was not well related to stand leaf area, seasonal interception or small-clearing seasonal snow accumulation. At the stand scale, physically based snow interception equations predicted seasonal snow accumulation from the stand leaf area and the seasonal snow accumulation or snowfall in adjacent clearings. A simple parametric from of these equations showed the sensitivity of seasonal snow accumulation to leaf area at the forest stand scale and suggested a relationship to extrapolate snow accumulation or snowfall measurements from clearings to forest. These relationships, developed from Canadian boreal forest observations, are consistent with Kuz'min's (1960. Formirovanie Snezhnogo Pokrova i Metody Opredeleniya Snegozapasov. Gidrometeoizdat: Leningrad) relationship between accumulation and canopy density derived from Russian observations, suggesting a good degree of transferability.

abstract = {Diatom-based inferences of post-glacial hydrological change from a sedimentary record from Felker Lake, British Columbia, show millennial-scale pacing of climate over the past approximately 11670 calendar years with change at ca. 8140 cal. year BP, ca. 6840 cal. year BP, ca. 5700 cal. year BP, and ca. 2230 cal. year BP. Early postglacial diatom assemblages are dominated by fragilaroid taxa, suggesting that cool and moist climate conditions and relatively high lake levels prevailed at this time. Early Holocene warming near ca. 8140 cal. year BP promoted Cyclotella bodanica var. lemanica, a fall bloomer competitive in limnological conditions associated with warmer water and stratified conditions. Short-lived peaks of Stephanodiscus parvus/minutulus between ca. 6340 cal. year BP and ca. 5860 cal. year BP indicate periodic increases in nutrient availability and prolonged mixing likely associated with long cool and moist spring seasons. The diatom-inferred depth of Felker Lake increased during the mid-Holocene to reach a record high-stand at ca. 5860 cal. year BP. Large changes in hydrological variability and terrestrial vegetation at Felker Lake occurred after ca. 2230 cal. year BP when high-amplitude centennial-scale fluctuations in diatom-inferred lake depth and salinity are observed. Change is first documented in terrestrial vegetation at this time by a shift from open Pinus parklands to a landscape that periodically supported populations of Cupressaceae. Three record low-stand high-salinity events are reconstructed between ca. 1910 cal. year BP and ca. 1800 cal. year BP, ca. 1030 cal. year BP and ca. 690 cal. year BP, and ca. 250 cal. year BP and ca. 140 cal. year BP. The low lake-level episode of ca. 1030 cal. year BP-ca. 690 cal. year BP is coeval with the Medieval Warm Period (ca. 1000 cal. year BP-ca. 600 cal. year BP), a period of intense drought in western North America. Post-glacial hydrological change at Felker Lake is coherent with regional, hemispherical, and global paleoclimate events, suggesting that millennial-and centennial-scale shifts in water availability are a persistent feature of the climate of western North America.},

abstract = {The primary goal of glacial geomorphology is to provide physically-based explanations of the past, present and future impacts of glaciers and ice sheets on landform and landscape development. To achieve this requires the integration of studies of landform with studies of the processes responsible for form development (over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales). During the twentieth century significant improvements in approaches to recognizing and describing glacial landforms have been matched by impressive advances in understanding and modeling ice flow and glacial erosion and deposition processes. At present process models are being tested explicitly in terms of predicting the development of known forms (which also provides new insight into the controls on form development). Evaluations of the implications of deformable beds for process and form development are also being attempted. Finally, we are reassessing long-held beliefs about the significance of glacial action in landform development and sediment production. As we head towards the twenty-first century, glacial geomorphology, will advance through the use of three-dimensional numerical models that include ice flow, basal sliding (with explicit consideration of deformable beds), erosion and deposition processes, and underlying material characteristics. These models will be used to address form evolution and test process models, and will include both the temporal and spatial aspects of form development. Space-based landform recognition, as well as the challenges presented by the concerns of global change, will place heightened emphasis on large-scale problems, which will include reexamination of the basic significance of glacial versus nonglacial action in landform development and sediment production.},

abstract = {Most glaciers in the British Columbia Coast Mountains reached their maximum Holocene extent during the Little Ice Age. Early- and late-Little Ice Age intervals of expansion and retreat fluctuations describe a mass-balance response to changing climates. Although existing dendroclimatic records provide insights into these climatic fluctuations over the last 400. yr, their short durations prohibit evaluation of early-Little Ice Age climate variability. To extend the duration of these records, submerged coarse woody debris salvaged from a high-elevation lake was cross-dated to living chronologies. The resulting chronology provides the opportunity to reconstruct a regional June-July air-temperature anomaly record extending from AD. 1225 to 2010. The reconstruction shows that the intervals AD. 1350-1420, 1475-1550, 1625-1700 and 1830-1940 characterized distinct periods of below-average June-July temperature followed by periods of above-average temperature. Our reconstruction provides the first annually resolved insights into high-elevation climates spanning the Little Ice Age in this region and indicates that Little Ice Age moraine stabilization corresponds to persistent intervals of warmer-than-average temperatures. We conclude that coarse woody debris submerged in high-elevation lakes has considerable potential for developing lengthy proxy climate records, and we recommend that researchers focus attention on this largely ignored paleoclimatic archive. {\textcopyright} 2012 University of Washington.},

abstract = {The Holocene sedimentary infill of proglacial Mud Lake, British Columbia, Canada, was investigated using 3.5 kHz acoustic sub-bottom profiling and sediment samples. The sediment infill is a mixture of silt and clay and is divided into five stratigraphic units: massive silt (Unit 1), weakly laminated silt with very fine sand beds (Unit 2), weakly laminated silt with rippled beds of fine sand (Unit 3), weakly laminated clay with very fine sand laminations (Unit 4) and silt-clay varves (Unit 5). Acoustic reflectors correlate with stratigraphic unit boundaries. Annual accumulation rates were estimated for six age/depth intervals: prior to 9.6 kyr cal. BP, accumulation rates were very high - on the order of several centimetres per year. Early to middle Holocene sediment inputs (9.6-3.6 kyr cal. BP) were variable but low, ranging from 0.3 mm/yr to 1.2 mm/yr. The late Holocene (most recent 3.6 kyr) shows annual accumulation rates that generally exceed 2 mm/yr. Surface sediment reveals a mean of 4.3 mm/yr over the last 20 years. These results are consistent with regional Holocene chronologies and long-term paraglacial succession: (1) maximum sediment and meltwater availability and minimum stabilization by vegetation following Fraser deglaciation replaced by (2) less meltwater and sediment availability during the Hypsithermal, and (3) more stabilized sediment during the early and mid Holocene. Renewal of glacial activity, particularly in the late Neoglacial, has led to increased rates of accumulation in Mud Lake. Despite the contrasting geologic setting of Mud Lake in the Omineca belt, contemporary sediment yield is consistent with the trend of sediment yield with glacier cover in lakes of the adjacent Foreland belt.},

Typically, the downscaling and/or extrapolation are performed using a constant temperature lapse rate, which is often taken to be the free-air moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALR: 6°–7°C km−1). To explore the validity of this approach, the authors examined altitudinal gradients in daily mean air temperature along six transects across four glaciers in the Canadian high Arctic. The dataset includes over 58 000 daily averaged temperature measurements from 69 sensors covering the period 1988–2007. Temperature lapse rates near glacier surfaces vary on both daily and seasonal time scales, are consistently lower than the MALR (ablation season mean: 4.9°C km−1), and exhibit strong regional covariance. A significant fraction of the daily variability in lapse rates is associated with changes in free-atmospheric temperatur...},

abstract = {A new interception model was integrated in a snowmelt model and for the first time the spatial variability of forest snow was effectively represented due to the inclusion of new forest structure metrics. The model was tested at 1273 field points surrounding Davos, Switzerland, that feature an extremely wide range of canopy and forest structure. The behavior of the new model was compared against a widely applied interception model. Due to the inclusion of novel forest structure parameters (mean distance to canopy and total gap area) in the new model, simulated interception mimicked the horizontal layout of canopy structure, while the standard interception model yielded fairly homogeneous interception estimations even under highly heterogeneous canopy conditions. The large variance of estimated interception between points using the new model translated into significant effects on under-canopy snow water equivalent and snow depth. Precipitation conditions were also analyzed, and further differences between the models were related to storm intensity. In climates characterized by large storm events, the new interception model provides significantly higher interception estimations (i.e., lower under-canopy snow) than the standard model, whereas in climates characterized by small storms events, the new model yields lower interception estimations (i.e., higher under-canopy snow) in areas with moderately sized to large canopy gaps.},

A model was constructed by combining the energy balance equations with relationships describing the other components of the snow accumulation and ablation processes. The Stanford Watershed Model is used to determine the time delay from when water leaves the snow pack to the streamflow gaging station. Tests of the model on 5 years of data from the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory resulted in a reasonable simulation of the observed mean daily flow hydrograph and seasonal areal snow cover plot. It is concluded that the model is at least a good approximation to the actual physical processes and should be a valuable tool in further snow hydrology investigations.

abstract = {This paper discusses the development and testing of snow algorithms with specific reference to their use and application in land surface models, New algorithms, developed by the authors, for estimating snow interception in forest canopies, blowing snow transport and sublimation, snow cover depletion and open environment snowmelt are compared with field measurements. Existing algorithms are discussed and compared with field observations. Recommendations are made with respect to: (a) density of new and aged snow in open and forest environments; (b) interception of snow by evergreen canopies; (c) redistribution and sublimation of snow water equivalent by blowing snow; (d) depletion in snow-covered area during snowmelt; (e) albedo decay during snowmelt; (f) turbulent transfer during snowmelt; and (g) soil heat flux during meltwater infiltration into frozen soils. Preliminary evidence is presented, suggesting that one relatively advanced land surface model, CLASS, significantly underestimates the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt rates in open environments despite overestimating radiation and turbulent contributions to melt. The cause(s) may be due to overestimation of ground heat loss and other factors. It is recommended that further studies of snow energetics and soil heat transfer in frozen soils be undertaken to provide improvements for land surface models such as CLASS, with particular attention paid to establishing the reliability of the models in invoking closure of the energy equation.

More than a billion people rely on water from snow, most of which originates in the Northern Hemisphere mountain ranges. Yet, remote sensing observations of mountain snow depth are still lacking at the large scale. Here, we show the ability of Sentinel-1 to map snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere mountains at 1 km² resolution using an empirical change detection approach. An evaluation with measurements from $\sim$4000 sites and reanalysis data demonstrates that the Sentinel-1 retrievals capture the spatial variability between and within mountain ranges, as well as their inter-annual differences. This is showcased with the contrasting snow depths between 2017 and 2018 in the US Sierra Nevada and European Alps. With Sentinel-1 continuity ensured until 2030 and likely beyond, these findings lay a foundation for quantifying the long-term vulnerability of mountain snow-water resources to climate change.},

abstract = {Two lacustrine sediment cores from Oldevatnet in western Norway have been studied in order to produce a record of floods, mass-wasting events and glacier fluctuations during the last 7300 years. River floods, density currents and snow-avalanches have deposited distinct 'event layers' at the lake floor throughout this time interval. In this study, a novel approach has been applied to distinguish event layers from the continuous background sedimentation, using Rb/Sr-ratios from X-Ray Fluorescence data. Grain-size distribution and the sedimentological parameters 'mean' and 'sorting' were used to further infer the depositional processes behind each layer. Our data suggest a record dominated by snow-avalanches, with the largest activity occurring during the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA). This increase in snow-avalanche activity observed during the LIA was probably caused by a combination of generally increasing winter precipitation and the advance of local glaciers towards the steep valley sides. Several fluctuations in snow-avalanche activity are also recognized prior to the LIA. Proxies of glacial activity from the background sediments indicate a similar development as earlier palaeoclimatic reconstructions from the area. It differs from previous reconstructions, however, by suggesting a lower glacial activity in the period from 2200 to 1000 cal. yr BP. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {A new, two-layer canopy module with thermal inertia as part of the detailed snow model SNOWPACK (version 3.2.1) is presented and evaluated. As a by-product of these new developments, an exhaustive description of the canopy module of the SNOWPACK model is provided, thereby filling a gap in the existing literature. In its current form, the two-layer canopy module is suited for evergreen needleleaf forest, with or without snow cover. It is designed to reproduce the difference in thermal response between leafy and woody canopy elements, and their impact on the underlying snowpack or ground surface energy balance. Given the number of processes resolved, the SNOWPACK model with its enhanced canopy module constitutes a sophisticated physics-based modeling chain of the continuum going from atmosphere to soil through the canopy and snow. Comparisons of modeled sub-canopy thermal radiation to stand-scale observations at an Alpine site (Alptal, Switzerland) demonstrate improvements induced by the new canopy module. Both thermal heat mass and the two-layer canopy formulation contribute to reduce the daily amplitude of the modeled canopy temperature signal, in agreement with observations. Particularly striking is the attenuation of the nighttime drop in canopy temperature, which was a key model bias. We specifically show that a single-layered canopy model is unable to produce this limited temperature drop correctly. The impact of the new parameterizations on the modeled dynamics of the sub-canopy snowpack is analyzed. The new canopy module yields consistent results but the frequent occurrence of mixed-precipitation events at Alptal prevents a conclusive assessment of model performance against snow data. The new model is also successfully tested without specific tuning against measured tree temperature and biomass heat-storage fluxes at the boreal site of Norunda (Sweden). This provides an independent assessment of its physical consistency and stresses the robustness and transferability of the chosen parameterizations. The SNOWPACK code including the new canopy module, is available under Gnu General Public License (GPL) license and upon creation of an account at https://models.slf.ch/.},

abstract = {This paper presents the issues in snow water equivalent (SWE) determination using acoustic reflectometry. To determine SWE, the density and the depth of each layer of snow in a snow pack need to be estimated. A noninvasive acoustic reflectometry technique to estimate the SWE is proposed in the mentioned paper, in which it is shown that SWE of the snowpacks with approximately 100 cm depth can be determined using a maximum length sequence (MLS) of length 7 as a probe signal. We performed similar experiments as reported in the mentioned paper to determine SWE using acoustic reflectometry but failed to replicate the given method. The signal processing-related issues such as design of probe signal, direct pickup problem, and so on of the mentioned paper are investigated and presented in this communication. We show that it is not possible to extract the reflection response by using the MLS of length 7 as a probe signal. The amount of sound attenuation and absorption in the snow medium is very high, of the order of 1 dB/cm and greater depending on the frequency, as reported in the literature and measured by us. Hence, the depth of snowpack investigated in the mentioned paper is practically difficult to achieve using conventional loudspeaker and microphone. Also, it has been explained how the cross-correlation peak width and, hence, the layer resolution achieved by the authors of the mentioned paper is not practically feasible by their reported method. We have also demonstrated that Wiener spiking deconvolution-based technique is not able to obtain the sharp peaks as shown in the mentioned paper.},

abstract = {Modeling snow hydrology for cold regions remains a problematic aspect of many hydro-environmental models. Temperature-index methods are commonly used and are routinely justified under the auspices that process-based models require too many input data. To test this claim, we used a physical, process-based model to simulate snowmelt at four locations across the conterminous US using energy components estimated from measured daily maximum and minimum temperature, i.e. using only the same data required for temperature-index models. The results showed good agreement between observed and predicted snow water equivalents, average R2>0.9. We duplicated the simulations using a simple temperature-index model best fitted to the data and results were poorer, R 2<0.8. At one site we applied the process-based model without substantial parameter estimation, and there were no significant ($\alpha$=0.05) differences between these results and those obtained using temperature-estimated parameters, despite relatively poorly predicted specific energy budget components (R2<0.8). These results encourage the use of mechanistic snowmelt modeling approaches in hydrological models, especially in distributed hydrological models for which landscape snow distribution may be controlled by spatially distributed components of the environmental energy budget. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predicting the rate of snowmelt and intercepted snow sublimation in boreal forests requires an understanding of the effects of snow-covered conifers on the exchange of radiant energy. This study examined the amount of intercepted snow on a jack pine canopy in the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan and the shortwave and net radiation exchange with this canopy, to determine the effect of intercepted snow and canopy structure on shortwave radiation reflection and extinction and net radiation attenuation in a boreal forest. The study focused on clear sky conditions, which are common during winter in the continental boreal forest. Intercepted snow was found to have no influence on the clear-sky albedo of the canopy, the extinction of short wave radiation by the canopy or ratio of net radiation at the canopy top to that at the surface snow cover. Because of the low albedo of the snow-covered canopy, net radiation at the canopy top remains positive and a large potential source of energy for sublimation. The canopy albedo declines somewhat as the extinction efficiency of the underlying canopy increases. The extinction efficiency of short wave radiation in the canopy depends on solar angle because of the approximately horizontal orientation of pine branches. For low solar angles above the horizon, the extinction efficiency is quite low and short wave transmissivity through the canopy is relatively high. As the solar angle increases, extinction increases up to angles of about 50°, and then declines. Extinction of short wave radiation in the canopy strongly influences the attenuation of net radiation by the canopy. Short wave radiation that is extinguished by branches is radiated as long wave, partly downwards to the snow cover. The ratio of net radiation at the canopy top to that at the snow cover surface increases with the extinction of short wave radiation and is negative for low extinction efficiencies. For the pine canopy examined, the daily mean net radiation at the snow cover surface became positive when daily mean solar angles exceeded 22° in late March. Hence, canopy structure and solar angle control the net radiation at the snow cover surface during clear sky conditions and will govern the timing and rate of snowmelt. Models of intercepted snow sublimation and forest snowmelt could beneficially incorporate the canopy radiation balance, which can be extrapolated to stands of various canopy densities, coverage and heights in a physically based manner. Such models could hence avoid 'empirical' temperature index measures that cannot be extrapolated with confidence.},

abstract = {A set of 57 novel canopy metrics of potential value for snow modeling were created from airborne LiDAR data. The metrics were meant to estimate size and relative location of gap openings around a point within forested areas, allowing for measures of the spatial arrangement of surrounding canopy elements. These new metrics were correlated with snow interception measured in the field (8488 manually measured snow interception points). The results were further compared to the correlation values between effective interception and traditionally used forest parameters (CC and LAI). The correspondence between all metrics was also analyzed in order to understand the potential cross correlation between each variable. LAI (average R: 0.57) demonstrated low correlations when directly compared to snow interception and further showed a large cross correlation with canopy closure (average R: 0.72). A new metric, 'mean distance to canopy' had the highest correlation (average R: 0.78) over all storm events to the effective interception. But in contrast to LAI, this metric did not show any cross correlation with canopy closure (CC). Likewise, 'total gap area,' an indirect measurement of apparent gap fraction (another new metric), also showed a high correlation to effective interception (average R: 0.72) without demonstrating a significant cross correlation to CC or to mean distance to canopy. These findings suggest that modeling forest snow processes with both CC and LAI may not be the best option due to both the low correlation of LAI as well as high cross correlation between these parameters. However, the pairing of mean distance to canopy and/or total gap area with canopy closure could give more robust estimations of snow interception within heterogeneous terrain.},

These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward.

abstract = {Saltation of snow, the transport of snow in periodic contact with and directly above the snow surface, is governed by the atmospheric shear forces applied to the erodible snow surface, the nonerodible surface, and the moving snow particles. Empirical data measured over a snow-covered plain suggest functions for parameters important to the apportionment of atmospheric shear forces; the aerodynamic roughness height during saltation, the mean horizontal velocity of saltating particles, and the efficiency of the saltation process. The resulting mass transport expression shows an approximately linear increase in snow saltation transport rate with friction velocity, in agreement with the measurements presented. The expression is sensitive to the cohesion of the snow surface, as indexed by the threshold wind speed, that wind speed at which transport ceases; for wind speeds well above the threshold condition, higher threshold wind speeds correspond to higher transport rates. An adaptation of the expression allows calculation of the mass concentration of saltating snow from measured data and the transport rate of saltating snow from the mean wind speed at 10 m height. Application of the transport rate expression using measured wind speeds, directions, and weather observations demonstrates that the directional component of annual saltating snow transport does not always correspond with wind direction frequency. Redistribution of surface snow by wind transport significantly affects the winter microclimate, snow cover accumulation , and hence snowmelt runoff patterns in cold, windswept regions. Several authors suggest that a large component of the mass flux of wind-transported snow travels in saltation, which is the horizontal movement of particles in curved trajectories, which are near to and periodically impact the surface [Dyunin, 1967; Male, 1980; Schmidt, 19861. Saltating snow particles are ice particles changing in form from both sublimation and abrasion. Schmidt's [I9811 observations show particles approximating spheroids with mean diameters of 200 pm, and a range of diameters from approximately 10 pm to several hundred micrometers. They are assumed to have the density of ice. Saltating snow differs significantly from saltation of other materials in that the "bed" is not a layer of rounded particles but is a cohesive matrix of bonded crystals which are metamorphosed by the impact of saltating particles and the vapor transfer during ventilation. Saltating snow particles are derived from shattered surface snow crystals, and Schmidt [I9801 has shown that the intercrystal bond strength, "cohesion," is a much more important parameter than crystal size in calculating the force required to eject a crystal. Particle impact is expected to result in rebound, with a shattering and reestablishment of bonds in the matrix and a "splashing" of crystals from the matrix.},

An energy balance snowmelt model is used to simulate snowmelt processes during this event in the Central Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Data from paired open and forested experimental sites at locations at and just below the Pacific Crest were used to drive the model. The event was preceded by cold, stormy conditions that developed a significant snow cover down to elevations as low as 500 m in the Oregon Cascades. At the start of the storm, the depth of the snow cover at the high site (1142 m) was 1.97 m with a snow water equivalent (SWE) of 425 mm, while at the mid-site (968 m) the snow cover was 1.14 m with a SWE of 264 mm. During the 5-6 day period of the storm the open high site received 349 mm of rain, lost 291 mm of SWE and generated 640 mm of runoff, leaving only 0.22 m of snow on the ground. The mid-site received 410 mm of rain, lost 264 mm of SWE to melt and generated 674 mm of runoff, completely depleting the snow cover. Simulations at adjacent forested sites showed significantly less snowmelt during the event. The snow cover under the mature forest at the high site lost only 44 mm of SWE during the event, generating 396 mm of runoff and leaving 0.69 m of snow. The model accurately simulated both snow cover depth and SWE during the development of the snow cover prior to the storm, and the depletion of the snow cover during the event. This analysis shows that because of the high temperature, humidity and relatively high winds in the open sites during the storm, 60-90% of the energy for snowmelt came from sensible and latent heat exchanges. Because the antecedent conditions extended the snow cover to very low elevations in the basin, snowmelt generated by condensation during the event made a significant contribution to the flood. Flower wind speeds beneath the forest canopy during the storm reduced the magnitude of the turbulent exchanges at the snow surface, so the contribution of snowmelt to the runoff from forested areas was significantly less. This experiment shows the sensitivity of snowmelt processes to both climate and land cover, and illustrates how the forest canopy is coupled to the hydrological cycle in mountainous areas.},

abstract = {Mining is known to be a major source of metal contamination for fluvial systems worldwide. Monitoring and understanding the effects on downstream water and sediment quality is essential for its management and to mitigate against detrimental environmental impacts. This study aimed to examine the effects of the small-scale, abandoned, hydraulic Black Creek gold mine on the geochemical content of fine (<63 $\mu$m) stream bed and floodplain sediment in the Horsefly watershed (British Columbia, Canada), which is a part of the Quesnel River basin. Concentrations of As, Cd, Se and Zn were determined by aqua regia digestion and the modified BCR (European Community Bureau of Reference) sequential extraction procedure followed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy or inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Age-depth models for the floodplain cores were constructed using excess Pb-210 and Cs-137 activity concentration profiles. The results show that the mine caused local As contamination of the Horsefly River floodplain sediment during the first years of operation, but at present the contamination is mainly contained in the Black Creek. Present-day and recent concentrations of Cd, Se and Zn in the Horsefly River are elevated and this is probably derived from other upstream mining activities. The spatial and temporal changes in heavy-metal concentrations suggest a slight, but not particularly widespread, mining effect on the fine-sediment geochemistry in the Horsefly River system. },

The data are weakly multifractal over periods shorter than one month, which controls their scaling properties and which can be used to statistically downscale monthly data to shorter-duration values. Although the daily snowfall values appear to be stationary, their multifractality displays much temporal variability, with most sites showing statistically-significant trends. Through use of a physically-based hydrological model, it is demonstrated that the variability of the multiscaling of snowfall can affect the timing and quantity of snow accumulation in catchments where the snowpacks are subject to wind redistribution. Therefore trends in scaling, based on multifractal characteristics, should be taken into account when downscaling climate model scenario outputs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

abstract = {A new model is presented for simulating snow surface albedo in the open and beneath a mixed‐forest canopy. The model has modest input data requirements and is an efficient physically based parameterization that includes the dependency of albedo on solar zenith angle, cloud cover, canopy, snow grain size, litterfall, snowfall, snow depth, and partial snow cover. Measurements used in the model validation include incident spectral irradiances, wavelength‐integrated visible and near‐infrared albedos, snowfall records, snow depth, snow surface litter fractions, and quantity of fine litter in snow cores. Measured and modelled forest snow albedos were less than open snow albedos during the accumulation phase, when there was little or no surface litter. The model predicts lower albedos in the forest during the accumulation phase because of a spectral shift to less reflective wavelengths of incident radiation under the canopy. Snow grain size was important during both the accumulation and ablation phases. Surface litter fraction, incident spectra, snowpack depth, and partial snow cover were important factors lowering forest albedo during ablation. Despite lower mid‐winter albedos in the forest, the snow melted more rapidly in the open. During late ablation, snow albedo in the open became lower than snow albedo in the forest, because of the thinner snow in the open. At the end of the ablation season, partial snow cover affected the albedo in the forest over a longer time period than in the open. Additional work is needed to improve the physical basis of the grain growth model used here and to develop a spatial albedo model for open and forested terrain.

Our reconstructions display synchronous multidecadal temperature fluctuations that are coherent with one another and with fully forced millennial model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 across the Common Era. A substantial portion of pre-industrial (1300-1800 CE) variability at multidecadal timescales is attributed to volcanic aerosol forcing. Reconstructions and simulations qualitatively agree on the amplitude of the unforced global mean multidecadal temperature variability, thereby increasing confidence in future projections of climate change on these timescales. The largest warming trends at timescales of 20 years and longer occur during the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades.},

abstract = {AbstractTo develop an empirical model for ground snow sublimation beneath canopy, a weighing measurement experiment was conducted using snow samples with different density in the broadleaved Koreanpine mixed forest in Changbai Mountains, Northeastern China. Eddy covariance measurement for water vapor flux was used to evaluate the model performance. Eddy covariance data showed that the daytime sublimation was much larger than the nighttime sublimation, and 94.3% of daily sublimation occurred within the 8 h from 8:00 to 16:00. Daytime sublimation showed a linear relationship with snow density, and the regression coefficients between them varied with meteorological variables. The regression slope was closely correlated to solar radiation (R2=0.92) and water vapor pressure (R2=0.79), whereas the regression intercept was closely correlated to air temperature (R2=0.92). Based on the regression relationships among sublimation, snow density, and meteorological variables, a nonlinear empirical sublimation model with a combination of snow density, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, and air temperature was developed. Sublimation estimation of the empirical model matched the eddy covariance data giving R2=0.83 and root mean square error (RMSE)=0.05 mm{\textperiodcentered}d−1. The surface reflectivity decreased with the increase in snow density. Dense snowpack would absorb more energy and promote snow sublimation by increasing the vertical water vapor pressure deficit between snow surface and atmosphere.},

abstract = {Key message: Foliage clumping can be estimated from logarithm averaging method in LAI-2000. The spatial scaling of clumping effects considered by the instrument is dependent on the sensor's azimuthal view. Accurate estimates of foliage clumping index ($\Omega$) are required to improve the retrieval of leaf area index (L) from optical instruments like LAI-2000/2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer (PCA) and digital hemispherical photography (DHP). The logarithm averaging method is often used to approximate L because clumping effects are considered at scales larger than the sensor's field of view. However, the spatial scaling considered for logarithm averaging typically differs between PCA and DHP, resulting in different estimates of foliage clumping. Based on simulation, we demonstrated that applying restricting azimuth view caps (e.g., 45° or 10°) allows reliable estimation of $\Omega$ and more accurate estimation of L from PCA. Simulated $\Omega$ and L values were comparable to those measured using the PCA, DHP and litter traps. Linear averaging of the gap fractions across readings at a plot or site yields a concurrent estimate of effective leaf area index (Le), thus enabling the calculation of Le, L, and $\Omega$ from a single instrument fitted with view caps. Users need to be aware that the method they use for averaging gap fractions determines whether they are measuring Le or L, and PCA users need to be aware that they are applying increasingly large corrections for foliage clumping as they use more restrictive view caps, a fact that they can use to their advantage to improve estimates of L.},

abstract = {Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30–40% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow‐cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land‐surface data to flag snow‐cloud identification errors and improve snow‐map accuracy reducing bias by 20% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow‐mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow‐dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow‐covered areas. Plain Language Summary Mapping snow cover extent informs water resources stored in the winter snowpack, providing important information for planning how and when to utilize available water. Tree canopies shield the forest floor and hinder the determination of snow‐covered area in vegetated terrain from above, where satellites view the Earth's surface. Moreover, satellites that scan the surface (like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) are most often not directly overhead, and as the view from the satellite to the surface slants, trees obscure a greater portion of the land surface that a satellite can “see,” especially where trees are tall, adding uncertainty to the satellite‐based maps. This effect is greatest in forests where 30–40% of the land area is covered by tree canopy and has little effect in very dense forests where most of the forest floor is obscured already. Here we present a method to accommodate the stretched and hidden forest footprint when a satellite is not directly overhead. A new method for identifying snow‐mapping errors caused by clouds is also presented by flagging unusually large changes in the non‐snow surfaces over sequential images. These methodological advancements are important because snow‐melt water comprises a major portion of the water supply in many regions where humans live. Key Points The canopy correction methodology improves remotely sensed snow mapping accuracy in forested environments, reducing bias by 20% A novel cloud detection algorithm that uses fractional vegetation and rock coverage can reduce snow‐cloud identification errors Improved performance over previous snow mapping approaches enable melt out date identification within days of actual snow disappearance},

abstract = {Snow is one of the most crucial land surface processes over middle and high latitudes. A widely known deficiency of the Noah land model as used in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational models and the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research is that snowmelt occurs much too early. Through detailed diagnostics of the Noah output over the high‐altitude Niwot Ridge forest site (40.03°N, 105.55°W) and a boreal forest site (53.9°N, 104.7°W), six deficiencies in Noah model physics are identified along with improved formulations that (1) consider the vegetation shading effect on snow sublimation and snowmelt; (2) consider under‐canopy resistance; (3) revise the ground heat flux computation when snow is deep; (4) revise the momentum roughness length computation when snow is present; (5) revise the snow density computation near 0°C; and (6) increase the maximum iteration number from five to 30 in the turbulence computation. These revisions significantly improve Noah simulations of all snow processes such as snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and sensible and latent heat fluxes over these two forest sites. The revisions were also evaluated (without tunings) with an independent forest site and a grassland site, further confirming the robust and positive impacts of these revisions on Noah snow simulations. These modifications maintain the Noah model structure and do not introduce new prognostic variables, allowing easy implementation into NCEP operational models and into WRF. Furthermore, they are found to be as good as, or slightly better than, a much more complicated land model in the snow simulation over the three forest sites.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal variations of surface albedo on Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland, during the 1993 and 1994 ablation seasons are described. Correlation and regression analyses are used to explain the albedo variations in terms of independent meteorological and surface property variables. Parameterizations are developed which allow estimation of albedo variation in surface energy-balance models. Snow albedo is best estimated from accumulated daily maximum temperatures since snowfall. On “deep” snow (≥0.5 cm w.e. depth) a logarithmic function is used, while on “shallow” snow (<0.5 cm w.e. depth) an exponential function is used to enable the albedo to decay to the underlying ice or debris albedo. The transition from “deep” to “shallow” snow is calculated as a function of decreasing snow depth (combined r 2 = 0.65). This new parameterization performs better than earlier schemes because accumulated daily maximum temperatures since snowfall correlate strongly with snow grain-size and impurity concentration, the main physical controls on snow albedo. Ice albedo may be parameterized by its relationship to elevation (r 2 = 0.28), but this approach results in only a small improvement over the assumption of a constant mean ice albedo.},

abstract = {Downcore counting of laminations in varved sediments offers a direct and incremental dating technique for high-resolution climatic and environmental archives with at least annual and sometimes even seasonal resolution. The pioneering definition of varves by De Geer (1912) had been restricted to rhythmically deposited proglacial clays. One century later the meaning of 'varve' has been expanded to include all annually deposited laminae in terrestrial and marine settings. Under favourable basin configurations and environmental conditions, limnic varves are formed due to seasonality of depositional processes from the lake's water column and/or transport from the catchment area. Subsequent to deposition of topmost laminae, the physical preservation of the accumulating varved sequence requires the sustained absence of sediment mixing, for example via wave action or macrobenthic bioturbation. Individual (sub)laminae in varved lake sediments typically express contrasting colours, always differ in terms of their organic, chemical and/or mineralogical compositions, and often also differ with regard to grain-size. Various predominating climatic and depositional conditions may result in clastic, biogenic or endogenic (incl. evaporitic) varved sediments and their mixtures.To reliably establish a varve chronology, the annual character of laminations needs to be determined and verified in a multidisciplinary fashion. Sources and influences of possible errors in varve chronologies are best determined and constrained by repeated varve counts, and by including radioisotopes and correlation with historically documented events. A well-established varve chronology greatly enhances the scientific value of laminated limnic archives by securely anchoring the wealth of multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental information in the form of time-series for multidisciplinary investigations.Applications of varved records are discussed with special reference to advances since the 1980s. These span fields like calibrating radiometric dating methods, reconstructing past changes of the Earth's magnetic field or detecting fluctuations in solar forcing. Once a varve chronology is established it can be applied to precisely date events like volcanic ash layers, earthquakes or human impact, as well as short- and long-term climate (temperature, precipitation, wind, hydroclimatic conditions or flooding) and environmental changes (eutrophication, pollution). Due to their exceptional high temporal resolution and in combination with their robust and accurate "internal" time scale in calendar years, annually laminated sediments can be regarded as one of the most precious environmental archives on the continents. These records are necessary to extend temporally limited instrumental records back in time. As such they have societal relevance with regard to risk assessments related to natural hazards arising from e.g. flooding or volcanic eruptions.},

abstract = {Seismic records and evidence from sediment cores at Chilliwack Lake provide the basis for a long-term (postglacial) sediment budget for a 324-km 2 Cordilleran catchment. Chilliwack Lake (11.8km 2 surface area), situated in the North Cascade Mountains, near Chilliwack, British Columbia, was formed behind a valley-wide recessional moraine in the final phase of post-Fraser alpine glaciation. Seismic surveys highlight the postglacial lacustrine record, which is underlain by a thick layer of sediments related to deglacial sedimentation. Sediment cores provide details of grain-size fining from the delta to the distal lake basin. The cores also show a record of intermittent fire and debris flows. Magnetic measurements of lake sediments provide information on grain size, as well as a dating framework. The total postglacial lake-floor deposit volume is estimated to be 397 ± 27 × 10 6m 3. Including estimates of fan and delta deposition, the specific postglacial yield to the lake is calculated to be ∼86 ± 13Mgkm 2a -1. The sediment volume in the uppermost (Holocene) lacustrine layer is 128 ± 9 × 10 6m 3, representing ∼41 ± 4Mgkm 2a -1 in the Holocene. Compared with other Cordilleran lakes of similar size, particularly those with glacial cover in the watershed, Chilliwack Lake has experienced relatively modest rates of sediment accumulation. This study provides an important contribution to a growing database of long-term (postglacial) sediment yield data for major Cordilleran lakes, essential for advancing our understanding of the pace of landscape evolution in formerly glaciated mountainous regions. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {As demand for fresh water increases in tandem with human population growth and a changing climate, the need to understand the ecological tradeoffs of flow regulation gains greater importance. Environmental classification is a first step towards quantifying these tradeoffs by creating the framework necessary for analysing the effects of flow variability on riverine biota. Our study presents a spatially explicit hydrogeomorphic classification of streams and rivers in Washington State, USA and investigates how projected climate change is likely to affect flow regimes in the future. We calculated 99 hydrologic metrics from 15years of continuous daily discharge data for 64 gauges with negligible upstream impact, which were entered into a Bayesian mixture model to classify flow regimes into seven major classes described by their dominant flow source as follows: groundwater (GW), rainfall (RF), rain-with-snow (RS), snow-and-rain (SandR), snow-with-rain (SR), snowmelt (SM) and ultra-snowmelt (US). The largest class sizes were represented by the transitional RS and SandR classes (14 and 12 gauges, respectively), which are ubiquitous in temperate, mountainous landscapes found in Washington. We used a recursive partitioning algorithm and random forests to predict flow class based on a suite of environmental and climate variables. Overall classification success was 75%, and the model was used to predict normative flow classes at the reach scale for the entire state. Application of future climate change scenarios to the model inputs indicated shifts of varying magnitude from snow-dominated to rain-dominated flow classes. Lastly, a geomorphic classification was developed using a digital elevation model (DEM) and climatic data to assign stream segments as either dominantly able or unable to migrate, which was cross-tabulated with the flow types to produce a 14-tier hydrogeomorphic classification. The hydrogeomorphic classification provides a framework upon which empirical flow alteration-ecological response relationships can subsequently be developed using ecological information collected throughout the region. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

To investigate the relative importance of forest processes on snow density and SWE, we applied the SUMMA model at three sites representing diverse snow climates in Colorado (USA), Oregon (USA), and Alberta (Canada) for 5 years. First, control simulations were run for open and forest sites. Comparisons to observations showed the uncalibrated model with NLDAS‐2 forcing performed reasonably. Then, experiments were completed to isolate how forest processes affected modelled snowpack density and SWE, including: (1) mass reduction due to interception loss, (2) changes in the phase and amount of water delivered from the canopy to the underlying snow, (3) varying new snow density from reduced wind speed, and (4) modification of incoming longwave and shortwave radiation. Delivery effects (2) increased forest snowpack density relative to open areas, often more than 30%. Mass effects (1) and wind effects (3) decreased forest snowpack density, but generally by less than 6%. The radiation experiment (4) yielded negligible to positive effects (i.e., 0%–10%) on snowpack density. Delivery effects on density were greatest at the warmest times in the season and at the warmest site (Oregon): higher temperatures increased interception and melted intercepted snow, which then dripped to the underlying snowpack. In contrast, mass effects and radiation effects were shown to have the greatest impact on forest‐to‐open SWE differences, yielding differences greater than 30%. The study highlights the importance of delivery effects in models and the need for new types of observations to characterize how canopies influence the flux of water to the snow surface. Canopy process affecting bulk snowpack density are isolated and mechanistically investigated using the SUMMA model. Understanding these processes informs more accurate SWE retrievals and predictions.},

abstract = {Mountain forests affect spatial and temporal variability of snow processes through snow interception and by modifying the energy balance of snowpack. The high sensitivity of snow cover to seasonal temperatures in mid–latitude mountains is well known and is of particular interest with regard to a future warmer climate. The snowpack in the Pyrenees is expected to be the most impacted by climate change in the Mediterranean mountains, where future climate trends project rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation. This study analyzes how changes in temperature and precipitation can affect current forest–snow interactions in four forests, located near each other but under contrasting topographic settings, in the Spanish Pyrenees. This understanding will allow us to anticipate the future hydrological responses of Pyrenean forested mountain basins. The research was accomplished by performing a sensitivity analysis using simulations from the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) and by comparing forest canopy sites (F) vs. openings (O). The CRHM platform focuses on the incorporation of physically based descriptions of snow–dominated regions hydrological processes. It was found that forest cover induced different snowpack sensibility to climatic change conditions in the studied forests. Delayed onset of snow accumulation (F: 13 days{\textperiodcentered}°C−1; O: 5 days{\textperiodcentered}°C−1) and reduced snowpack duration (F: 28 %{\textperiodcentered}°C−1; O: 23 %{\textperiodcentered}°C−1) under warmer temperatures were more intense in areas beneath the forest canopy compared to openings. A lower annual peak of snow water equivalent (SWE) (F: 81 mm{\textperiodcentered}°C−1; O: 129 mm{\textperiodcentered}°C−1), earlier melt-out date (F: 8 days{\textperiodcentered}°C−1; O: 10 days{\textperiodcentered}°C−1) and slower melting rates (F: 0.4 mm{\textperiodcentered}day−1{\textperiodcentered}°C−1; O: 0.5 mm{\textperiodcentered}day−1{\textperiodcentered}°C−1) with increasing temperatures were more intense in forest openings. The forest–driven reduction in snowpack duration (40%) was significantly enhanced with warming (10% per °C). Lower precipitation (20% precipitation reduction) could increase the response of this forest effect to warming (32%), while higher precipitation (20% precipitation increment) could reduce it (−26%). There was relevant topographic variability in the forest−snow interactions in response to climate change among the study stands, despite their proximity.},

- Forest effects were sensitive to climate pertubations during the begining of the season when temperatures were already warmer
- They describe the reason for this as warmer temperatures lead to lower amounts of precip as snow and higher interception efficiency
- And any snow that is intercepted under warm conditions is likely to melt into the soil reducing snow accumulation.

- higher longwave energy inputs to forest during increased temperatures compensates for the decrease in solar input caused by earlier snow melt},

abstract = {The rotation rate of the Earth controls the deposition scale of turbidity currents when their flow transit-time is comparable to one day. Using laboratory experiments it is shown that the maximum length-scale L of deposition is set by the scale where the Rossby number of the current is equal to one. The dimensionless Rossby number is defined as Ro=U/fL, where U is a depth-averaged velocity of the turbidity current and f is the Coriolis parameter. In these new laboratory experiments the Coriolis parameter is varied by changing the platform rotation rate and there is good agreement between experimental observations and the prediction that the extent of the deposition scales as L$\sim$(4/$\pi$)1/4(g′V/f)1/4, where g′ is the reduced gravity and V the initial volume of the sediment-laden material. This scaling implies that the depositional patterns will vary with latitude, and that at higher latitudes one would expect smaller, thicker deposits. Using this scaling implies that the 200–400 km spatial extent of the turbidite arising during the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake had Ro$\sim$1, and so Coriolis forces controlled the length-scale of the turbidite deposition.},

A major glacial expansion in the 17th century is recorded at three sites, where I4C dates show glaciers reached their maximum down-valley positions. Lichenometric dates and tree growth suppression records show a phase of glacial activity early in the 18th century, for which there is only sparse morainic evidence. Most moraines in the area date from a glacial advance culminating in the mid-19th century, and moraine formation was complete everywhere by the late 1800's. Recessional moraines are rare in the study area and indicate that ice-front retreat has been relatively continuous since the 19th century. The glacial chronology developed in this work is comparable to that reconstructed for both the Main Ranges of the Canadian Rockies and the Coast Ranges of the southern Cordillera.},

The physics of glacier-climate interaction are relatively well understood, and glacier models can be used to reconstruct past climate from geological evidence of past glacier extent. This can lead to significant insights regarding past, present, and future climate. For example, glacier modeling has demonstrated that the near ubiquitous global pattern of glacier retreat during the last few centuries resulted from a global-scale climate warming of ∼1°C, consistent with instrumental data and climate proxy records. Climate reconstructions from glaciers have also demonstrated that the tropics were colder at the Last Glacial Maximum than was originally inferred from sea surface temperature reconstructions.

These are used to identify changes in extent and elevation primarily for the periods 1952–1985, 1985– 2005, and 1952–2005. All glaciers receded during the pe-riod 1952–2005; area retreat averaged −0.19 ± 0.05 % a −1 . From 1952 to 1985, nine glaciers advanced; following 1985, retreat rates accelerated to −0.41 ± 0.12 % a −1 . Thin-ning rates of a subset of seven glaciers likewise ac-celerated, from −0.14 ± 0.04 m w.e. a −1 (1952–1985) to −0.50 ± 0.07 m w.e. a −1 for the period 1985–2005. Temper-atures increased from the earlier to the latter period for the ablation (+0.38 • C) and accumulation (+0.87 • C) seasons, and average precipitation decreased, particularly in the ac-cumulation season (−32 mm, −3.2 %). Our comparison of surface area change with glacier morphometry corroborates previous studies that show primary relations between extent change and surface area. We also find that the strength and sign of these relations varied for different epochs. Our results also indicate that the 1985 glacier extent for the study area reported previously by other studies may be slightly overes-timated due to errant mapping of late-lying snow cover.},

abstract = {A physically based model built upon extensive field observations of radiation dynamics and snow processes in cold regions forest environments was used to investigate the impacts of prescribed forest gap-thinning treatments on spring snowmelt in a small Saskatchewan River headwater basin of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Both field observations and model simulations showed that snow accumulations in small clear-cut gaps was roughly double those under intact forest cover due to sublimation losses from the canopy. Consequently, mountain forests thinned with small clear-cut gaps resulted in a substantial increase in the magnitude of spring snowmelt. However, the impact of forest thinning on the timing of snowmelt was highly dependent on slope orientation; thinning accelerated snowmelt on south facing slopes primarily through enhanced shortwave radiation, but retarded snowmelt on north facing slopes primarily through reduced incoming longwave radiation. As a result, thinning treatments across opposing north facing and south facing mountain slopes acted to substantially expand the spring melt period in the basin, and illustrated the important hydrological control imparted by intact forest cover through its synchronization of snowmelt across complex terrain. A sensitivity analysis of snowmelt timing to varying spring meteorological conditions strongly suggests that shifts in spring snowmelt runoff from similar forest thinning treatments in mountain regions will depend on the slope and aspect at which they occur in combination with the seasonal timing of snowmelt resulting from latitude-controlled solar elevation effects. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Lago del Desierto (49°02′S, 72°51′W) is situated in the climatically sensitive area of Southern Patagonia close to the Hielo Patagonico Sur (HPS or South Patagonian Ice Field, Argentina). Next to marine records and Antarctic ice cores, this continental area is important to reveal hemispheric and global climate trends. As instrumental climate records from this region are generally short and scarce, environmental archives are the only source of long-term records of climate variations. In this study, the potential of laminated proglacial sediments from Lago del Desierto as a palaeoclimate archive is evaluated. Two parallel gravity cores (max. length 283cm) were analysed using a multi-proxy approach. Radiometric dating (14C, 210Pb and 137Cs) and tephrochronology document that the sediment cover the last 2000years. Especially in the middle part of the record, numerous turbidites make climate variations difficult to decipher. However, after exclusion of event layers changes in sedimentological, mineralogical, and geochemical parameters reveal a long-term trend of runoff variations and sediment accessibility controlled by changes in temperature and precipitation. An abrupt transition in sediment composition occurred around AD 850 and is interpreted as a change in sediment availability related to the initial exposure of formerly glaciated areas in the catchment. This striking change mirrors the onset of warmer climate conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Moreover, the Little Ice Age cooling and the subsequent 20th century warming can be traced in the sediment record corresponding to an overall trend observed for southern South America. The proglacial lacustrine sediment record of Lago del Desierto thus constitutes a link between glacier studies of the HPS and other terrestrial climate archives in a region were long, and continuous climate records are still rare. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Statistical analysis of the streamflow timing measures with Pacific climate indicators identified local and key large-scale processes that govern the regionally coherent parts of the changes and their relative importance. Widespread and regionally coherent trends toward earlier onsets of springtime snowmelt and streamflow have taken place across most of western North America, affecting an area that is much larger than previously recognized. These timing changes have resulted in increasing fractions of annual flow occurring earlier in the water year by 1-4 weeks. The immediate (or proximal) forcings for the spatially coherent parts of the year-to-year fluctuations and longer-term trends of streamflow timing have been higher winter and spring temperatures. Although these temperature changes are partly controlled by the decadal-scale Pacific climate mode [Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)], a separate and significant part of the variance is associated with a springtime warming trend that spans the PDO phases. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {In a naturally stratified snow cover the movement of meltwater into dry snow is complicated by the interaction of the wetting front with stratigraphic horizons. Field observations showed that when the wetting front reached premelt stratigraphic horizons, water ponded at the interface and then flow fingers developed and penetrated the lower stratum. The flux in these fingers, which was increased to about twice that of the surface flux, was used to feed water to the impeding horizons where it froze to form ice layers. These ice layers were the major source of latent heat released within the snow cover, and they were responsible for the warming of the snow and the underlying soil. These continuous ice layers grew only at stratigraphic boundaries. Because of this ice layer growth the wetting front advance was retarded, and the arrival of meltwater at the snow cover base was significantly delayed. Owing to a cold substrate the strong heat flux from the snow into the soil delays the warming of the snow cover and limits runoff after the snow is isothermal at 0{\o}C by the refreezing of soil infiltration and the development of a basal ice layer},

abstract = {Modern and historical sedimentation in Chephren Lake are examined in order to assess the relations between glacier activity, sediment production, and the lacustrine depositional record. Bottom sediment data and lake morphology indicate that sediments in the distal part of the lake primarily settled from suspension and that glaciers are the most important source. A 4.3 m core obtained from the distal sediments reveals that accumulation of fine, glacially-derived material has increased since at least 2420 BP. Simple geochemical indicators reflect this and support regional evidence for progressive (though punctuated) climate deterioration through the Neoglacial period. Distinct rhythmite sequences (especially beginning ca. 3460, 2330, 1470 and 530 BP) are thought to represent minor glacier retreats which help define separate phases of Neoglacial advance identified by previous workers. In contrast, increasing slope stability indicated by a reduction in graded sand and clast facies may be specific to slopes overlooking the coring site.},

Total yield averaged 320±40Mgkm-2a-1and comprised $\sim$35% suspended load, 50% bedload, and 15% dissolved load. Ratios between the individual yield components varied approximately threefold at interannual timescales because of significant variability in the suspended and bedload fractions. Asynchronous flux in suspended and bedload fractions through time arise from differences in sediment availability and transitory sediment storage in the channel. Periods of elevated yield coincide with rapid glacier recession, an extreme rainstorm, and a landslide. Our results indicate that in montane environments, extrapolation from even decade-long monitoring programs may lead to biased projections of long-term yield and delivery mode proportions if variations in sediment supply and catchment response to hydroclimatic and geomorphic controls are not considered. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The contribution of glaciers to runoff from large‐scale drainage basins in Europe is analyzed for the major streams originating in the Alps: Rhine, Rhone, Po, and Danube. Detailed information on glacier storage change is available from monthly mass balance data of 50 Swiss glaciers for the period 1908–2008. Storage changes are extrapolated to all glaciers in the European Alps. By comparing monthly runoff yields from glacierized surfaces in the summer months with measured runoff at gauges along the entire length of the streams, the relative portion of water from glacier storage change for each month is calculated. Macroscale drainage basins with a size of 100,000 km2 (1% ice‐covered) can show a 25% contribution of glaciers to August runoff over the last century. In the lower Danube (0.06% glacierization) glacier meltwater accounts for 9% of observed runoff in September of the extreme year 2003. The relative importance of glacier contribution to runoff does not scale linearly with the percentage of glacierization, as high glacier runoff in summer dominates lowland areas with little precipitation and high evapotranspiration. Thus, glacial meltwaters are relevant to the hydrological regime of macroscale watersheds and do not only have a regional impact. By transiently modeling future glacier retreat until 2100 using climate scenarios, a reduction of glacierized areas in the Alps to 12% of the current value is found. In consequence, summer runoff contribution from currently glacierized basins will be strongly reduced, intensifying issues with water shortage in summer also in poorly glacierized catchments.},

abstract = {Crop canopy decreases with increased soil moisture stress. Therefore, the soil evaporation (E) during the growing season will be affected. Leaf area index (LAI) and ground cover (GC) of cowpeas (Vigna sinensis, L.) were measured during the growing season on a line source sprinkler irrigation system receiving different amounts of irrigation to develop a function to predict LAI under different soil moisture conditions based on estimated evapotranspiration (ET). Microlysimeters were used to estimate E by differential weighing while ET was estimated by a water balance technique. Transpiration (T) was estimated by the difference between ET and E. A different relationship between ET and potential ET (ETp) and relative available water in the root zone (Sw) was obtained at Sw smaller than 0.42. The value of ET/ETp is 2.4 times Sw. The relationships between E/ET and LAI and GC have been modified by incorporation of (Sw) at different soil moisture conditions with (Sw) smaller than 0.42. Furthermore, no improvement was observed in estimating E/ET using GC instead of LAI at wet irrigation levels. It was found that the seasonal E/ET at wet irrigation levels (about 0.52) was almost equal to that of intermediate irrigation levels. However, at the dry irrigation levels the seasonal E/ET (0.59) was higher than that of wet irrigation levels owing to a smaller rate of increase of LAI and/or GC at dry irrigation levels. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

This special issue contains papers that use a variety of remote sensing technologies to derive forest inventory or inventory-related information. Herein, we review the potential of 4 advanced remote sensing technologies, which we posit as having the greatest potential to influence forest inventories designed to characterize forest resource information for strategic, tactical, and operational planning: airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), and high spatial resolution (HSR)/very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite optical imagery. ALS, in particular, has proven to be a transformative technology, offering forest inventories the required spatial detail and accuracy across large areas and a diverse range of forest types. The coupling of DAP with ALS technologies will likely have the greatest impact on forest inventory practices in the next decade, providing capacity for a broader suite of attributes, as well as for monitoring growth over time.},

abstract = {The Coast Mountains flank the Pacific Ocean in western British Columbia, Canada. Subdivided into the southern Pacific Ranges, central Kitimat Ranges and northern Boundary Ranges, the majority of large glaciers and icefields are located in the Boundary and Pacific ranges. Prior descriptions of the Holocene glacial history of this region indicate the Holocene was characterized by repeated episodes of ice expansion and retreat. Recent site-specific investigations augment our understanding of the regional character and duration of these events. In this paper, previously reported and new radiocarbon evidence is integrated to provide an updated regional assessment. The earliest evidence of glacier expansion in the Coast Mountains comes from the Boundary Ranges at 8.9 and 7.8 ka and in the Pacific Ranges at 8.5-8.2 ka, with the latter advance corresponding to an interval of rapid, global climate deterioration. Although generally warm and dry climates from 7.3 to 5.3 ka likely limited the size of glaciers in the region, there is radiocarbon evidence for advances over the interval from 7.3 to 6.0 and at 5.4-5.3 ka in the Pacific Ranges. Following these advances, glaciers in the Pacific Ranges expanded down valley at 4.8-4.6, 4.4-4.0, 3.5-2.6, 1.4-1.2, and 0.8-0.4 ka, while glaciers in Boundary Ranges were advancing at 4.1-4.0, 3.7-3.4, 3.1-2.8, 2.3, 1.7-1.1, and 0.8-0.4 ka. After 0.4 ka, it appears that most glaciers in the Coast Mountains continued to expand to attain their maximum Holocene extents by the early 18th to late 19th centuries. This enhanced record of Holocene glacier activity highlights the temporal synchrony in the Coast Mountains. Individual expansion events in the mid-to late Holocene broadly correspond to intervals of regional glacier activity reported in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, in Alaska, and on high-elevation volcanic peaks in Washington State.},

Here we analyse sediment cores from Lake Patzcuaro, Michoacan (Fig. 1), to derive a quantitative estimate of variations in soil erosion in central Mexico since 4,000 yr BP. We identify three periods of accelerated erosion and conclude that erosion rates during both the late Preclassic/early Classic periods (2,500-1,200 yr BP) and the later Postclassic period (850-350 yr BP) were at least as high as those after the Spanish conquest. One implication of these results is that soil erosion caused by the Spanish introduction of plough agriculture was apparently no more severe than that associated with traditional agricultural methods; it is therefore questionable whether a return to traditional methods would have significant environmental benefits.},

abstract = {Laser altimetry (lidar) is a remote-sensing technology that holds tremendous promise for mapping snow depth in snow hydrology and avalanche applications. Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.},

The Finnish Meteorological Institute Image Processing Toolbox (FMIPROT) has been used to retrieve the snow depth time series from camera images of a snow stake on the ground by implementing an algorithm based on the brightness difference and contour detection. Three case studies have been illustrated to highlight potentialities and pitfalls of time-lapse photography in retrieving the snow depth time series: Sodankyl{\"{a}} peatland, a boreal forested site in Finland, and Gressoney-La-Trinit{\'{e}} Dejola and Careser Dam, two alpine sites in Italy. This study presents new possibilities and advantages in the retrieval of snow depth in general and snow depth time series specifically, which can be summarized as follows: (1) high temporal resolution - hourly or sub-hourly time series, depending on the camera's scan rate; (2) high accuracy levels - comparable to the most common method (manual measurements); (3) reliability and visual identification of errors or misclassifications; (4) low-cost solution; and (5) remote sensing technique - can be easily extended in remote and dangerous areas.</p> <p>The proper geometrical configuration between camera and stake, highlighting the main characteristics which each single component must have, has been proposed. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSEs) were calculated for all three case studies comparing with estimates from both the FMIPROT and visual inspection of images directly. The NSE values were 0.917, 0.963 and 0.916, while RMSEs were 0.039, 0.052 and 0.108 m for Sodankyl{\"{a}}, Gressoney and Careser, respectively. In terms of accuracy, the Sodankyl{\"{a}} case study gave better results. The worst performances occurred at Careser Dam located at 2600 m a.s.l., where extreme weather conditions and a low temporal resolution of the camera occur, strongly affecting the clarity of the images.},

abstract = {Many studies have examined trends in the amount and phase of precipitation on the Canadian prairies over the period of record but without considering the unusual hydrology and hydrography of the region. On the Canadian prairies, runoff is primarily due to spring snowmelt over frozen soils but can also be caused by intense rainfall from summer thunderstorms. The fraction of spring snowmelt forming runoff is strongly influenced by the rate of melt and the presence of ice layers near the surface in frozen soils or at the base of the snowpack, all of which can be influenced by rainfall in the spring and late fall. Precipitation intensities sufficient to cause runoff are generally due to small, intense convective storms, which are prevalent during the summer months. Historical records of the fraction of monthly precipitation falling as rain, obtained from the Historical Adjusted Climate Database for Canada (HACDC), were found to display statistically significant increasing trends over the periods 1901-2000 and 1951-2000 at many locations on the Canadian prairies. The fraction of stations showing significant trends, and the importance of the trends, were strongly dependent on the month of the year. Single-day summer rainfalls are believed to be primarily convective in the Canadian prairies. Historical records obtained from HACDC indicate that the hydrological importance of single-day summer rainfalls has not increased and has shown significant decreases at many locations over the periods 1901-2000 and 1951-2000. Conversely, the hydrological importance of summer multiple-day rain events has not decreased and has significantly increased at many locations over the periods analysed. Multiscaling analyses of summer rainfall events demonstrated that the temporal uniformity of rainfall on the Canadian prairies has increased over the periods 1901-2000 and 1951-2000. Analyses of the ratios of rainfall over multiple days demonstrate significant trends over the same periods, confirming the general tendency to temporal uniformity over scales between 1 and 32days. Longer rain events strongly suggest greater spatial extents for storms and therefore the potential for increasing tendencies to promote basin-scale rainfall-runoff events such as seen in 2011 in the region. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Rain-on-snow (ROS) is a major contributor to flooding and landslides in many temperate coastal watersheds around the world. Research has shown that forest harvesting can increase melt rates during ROS at both the stand and watershed scale. Because of this, post disturbance hydrological recovery is of interest in watersheds where forest management is prevalent. Recent research that pairs events by frequency rather than chronologically has indicated that forest cover removal can have a significant effect on the magnitude and frequency of extreme events, which is counter to the dominant view in forest hydrology. Hydrological modelling provides a means to apply frequency based analysis in watersheds with short data records, but models must be tested and validated in coastal watersheds before they can be applied extensively. A key challenge to testing models is the inherent difficulty with collecting data in ROS environments. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to design a methodology that recorded previously unobserved processes, use these data to validate model simulations and assess stand level energy flux recovery during ROS. Data were collected at a range of elevations within recently harvested, regenerating and old growth forests. The Cold Regions Hydrological Model generally performed well at capturing the dynamics of snow accumulation and melt, however, snow water equivalent was generally over-predicted. Depths of transient snowpacks were generally under-predicted, however, once a snowpack was established model performance improved. Clear-cut forests had higher mean and greater variability of energy inputs resulting in large events occurring more frequently than in old or second growth forests. Energy flux recovery was evident within the regenerating forests; however, both the rates of recovery and differences among stands depended on the location and the variables compared. When either the mean or standard deviation of energy inputs differed from that of old growth forests, energy flux recovery was reduced as events became larger and less frequent. It is probable that results obtained from this study will translate to stream flow in watersheds with steep slopes, shallow soils and extensive preferential flow networks (i.e. high run-off coefficients), especially when run-off generating areas are synchronized.},

abstract = {There are many models that attempt to predict physical processes in snow on the ground for a range of applications, and evaluations of these models show that they have a wide range of behaviours. A review of snow models, however, shows that many of them draw on a relatively small number of process parameterizations combined in different configurations and using different parameter values. A single model that combines existing parameterizations of differing complexity in many different configurations to generate large ensembles of simulations is presented here. The model is driven and evaluated with data from four winters at an alpine site in France. Consideration of errors in simulations of snow mass, snow depth, albedo and surface temperature show that there is no " best" model, but there is a group of model configurations that give consistently good results, another group that give consistently poor results, and many configurations that give good results in some cases and poor results in others. There is no clear link between model complexity and performance, but the most consistent results come from configurations that have prognostic representations of snow density and albedo and that take some account of storage and refreezing of liquid water within the snow. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) has been applied over the years in coupled and uncoupled (offline) modes at local, regional, and global scales using various forcing datasets. In this study, CLASS is applied at a local scale in the offline configuration to evaluate its performance when driven by the ERA5 reanalysis. Simulated surface energy fluxes, as well as several other water balance components, are investi-gated at four sites across the Canadian boreal biome. The results from CLASS driven by ERA5 (CLASS-RNL) are compared with available in situ measurements, as well as with results from CLASS driven by observations (CLASS-CTL). Additional simulations are conducted to evaluate the effects of biases in the ERA5 precipitation, where CLASS is forced by ERA5 data, but with ERA5 precipitation being replaced by observed precipitation (CLASS-RNL-ObsP). The results show that simulated surface variables in CLASS-RNL are in good agreement with observations as well as with those simulated in CLASS-CTL. The CLASS-RNL captures well the observed annual cycles of the surface energy and water fluxes, as well as the year-to-year variation of snow depth, soil temperature, and soil moisture. A strong correlation is found between the observed and CLASS-RNL simulated snow depth and soil temperature. Biases in the ERA5 precipitation did not affect the simulation of soil state variables, whereas the simulated surface heat and water fluxes, as well as the snow depth, were significantly affected. For instance, the simulated runoff in CLASS-RNL is much higher than in CLASS-RNL-ObsP and CLASS-CTL at the most humid sites due to significant positive bias in ERA5 precipitation.},

The degree of complexity of these models is highly variable, ranging from simple index methods to multi-layer models that simulate snow-cover stratigraphy and texture. In the framework of the Snow Model Intercomparison Project (SnowMIP), 23 models were compared using observed meteorological parameters from two mountainous alpine sites. The analysis here focuses on validation of snow energy-budget simulations. Albedo and snow surface temperature observations allow identification of the more realistic simulations and quantification of errors for two components of the energy budget: the net short- and longwave radiation. In particular, the different albedo parameterizations are evaluated for different snowpack states (in winter and spring). Analysis of results during the melting period allows an investigation of the different ways of partitioning the energy fluxes and reveals the complex feedbacks which occur when simulating the snow energy budget. Particular attention is paid to the impact of model complexity on the energy-budget components. The model complexity has a major role for the net longwave radiation calculation, whereas the albedo parameterization is the most significant factor explaining the accuracy of the net shortwave radiation simulation.},

abstract = {Version 3.1 of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) contains a number of new algorithms of significance for snow simulations in the boreal forest. In particular, mixed precipitation is now modelled, the density of fresh snow varies with temperature and the maximum snowpack density varies with snow depth. A model for canopy interception and unloading of snow developed in the Canadian boreal forest has also been implemented. In this paper, nine-month column runs of CLASS 3.1 are compared with CLASS 2.7, the current operational version. The model runs span the winter of 2002-03 at three boreal forest sites: a mature aspen stand, a mature jack pine stand and a mature black spruce stand, all located in central Saskatchewan. The focus is on the winter performance and the representation of snow. More accurate (lower) values of modelled snow density improve the modelled snowpack depth. The accuracy of the canopy interception algorithm could not be tested directly with respect to measured interception, but results suggest that the ability to unload intercepted snow is important for accurate estimates of sublimation loss, and that simulated snow water equivalent is sensitive to perceived canopy gap fraction, interception capacity, and unloading rate. Underestimation of the canopy gap fraction increases canopy interception and sublimation losses, and decreases snow water equivalent in the snowpack, and vice versa. Employing modified gap fraction values improved the modelled snow water equivalent at two of the sites. Modifications to the model are suggested to allow the total albedo to respond to changes in the modelled sub-canopy albedo.},

Stream water could be partitioned into four distinct waters based upon event and flow path; however, similar division for lake water was not possible due to inconsistencies between tracer contents in the lake water. In terms of the major source of acidity, snow meltwater, stream water had an average meltwater content of 70% while near-shore lake water ranged from greater than 70% at spring melt commencement to less than 45% at the end.

However, there is no sufficient knowledge of the corresponding structure over complex topography. Another major issue in micrometeorological studies is the description of the turbulence with low wind speeds. Considering that almost all concentration of population and industry occurs in regions of complex terrain and that low wind speeds are the most critical ones to the dispersion of pollutants, additional studies are still essential in helping the understanding of the structure of PBL over such kind of terrain and such type of stability. This is the purpose of this paper in which a data set collected in a valley, using a sonic anemometer, is presented and discussed. Results reveal that the turbulence parameters in the convective and stable surface layer follow similarity relationships only if special conditions regarding wind direction and wind speed exist in relation to the surrounding terrain.

abstract = {Within mountainous regions, estimating the exchange of sensible heat and water vapor between the surface and the atmosphere is an important but inexact endeavor. Measurements of the turbulence characteristics of the near-surface boundary layer in complex mountain terrain are relatively scarce, leading to considerable uncertainty in the application of flux-gradient techniques for estimating the surface turbulent heat and mass fluxes. An investigation of the near-surface boundary layer within a 7-ha snow-covered forest clearing was conducted in the Kananaskis River valley, located within the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The homogeneous measurement site was characterized as being relatively calm and sheltered; the wind exhibited considerable unsteadiness, however. Frequent wind gusts were observed to transport turbulent energy into the clearing, affecting the rate of energy transfer at the snow surface. The resulting boundary layer within the clearing exhibited perturbations introduced by the surrounding topography and land surface discontinuities. The measured momentum flux did not scale with the local aerodynamic roughness and mean wind speed profile, but rather was reflective of the larger-scale topographical disturbances. The intermittent nature of the fluxgenerating processes was evident in the turbulence spectra and cospectra where the peak energy was shifted to lower frequencies as compared with those observed in more homogeneous flat terrain. The contribution of intermittent events was studied using quadrant analysis, which revealed that 50% of the sensible and latent heat fluxes was contributed from motions that occupied less than 6% of the time. These results highlight the need for caution while estimating the turbulent heat and mass fluxes in mountain regions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Forest snow interception can account for large snow storage differences between open and forested areas. The effect of interception can also lead to significant variations in sublimation, with estimates varying from 5 to 60% of total snowfall. Most current interception models utilize canopy closure and LAI to partition interception from snowfall and calculate interception efficiency as an exponential decrease of interception efficiency with increasing precipitation. However, as demonstrated, these models can show specific deficiencies within heterogeneous canopy. Seven field areas were equipped with 1932 surveyed points within various canopy density regimes in three elevation bands surrounding Davos, Switzerland. Snow interception measurements were taken from 2012 to 2014 (∼9000 samples) and compared with measurements at two open sites. The measured data indicated the presence of snow bridging from a demonstrated increase in interception efficiency as precipitation increased until a maximum was reached. As precipitation increased beyond this maximum, the data then exhibited a decrease in interception efficiency. Standard and novel canopy parameters were developed using aerial LiDAR data. These included estimates of LAI, canopy closure, distance to canopy, gap fraction, and various tree size parameters. These canopy metrics and the underlying efficiency distribution were then integrated to formulate a conceptual model based upon the snow interception measurements. This model gave a ∼27% increase in the r2 (from 0.39 to 0.66) and a ∼40% reduction in RMSE (from 5.19 to 3.39) for both calibration and validation data sets when compared to previous models at the point scale. When upscaled to larger grid sizes, the model demonstrated further increases in performance. Key Points: Showed a 27% increase in r2 and 40% RMSE reduction compared to prior models Canopy parameters that represent large‐scale features explained most variations Nine thousand interception measurements indicated a sigmoidal shaped interception efficiency},

abstract = {Two Jarvis-type models, the original Jarvis model (J-model) and the Green and McNaughton model (GM-model), were evaluated for estimating leaf stomatal resistance (rs) for a non-stressed maize canopy. The parameters of the models were optimized, and their performances were compared against measured rs. A new modified Jarvis-type model (NMJ-model) was developed by including a new term, r s-min exp(-LAI), where r s-min = minimum stomatal resistance (sm 1) and LAI = green leaf area index, to account for the influence of canopy development stage on rs, especially during partial canopy. Through an extensive field campaign, hourly rs, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), air and leaf temperatures (Ta and TL), porometer cup temperature (Tc), air relative humidity above the canopy (RHa) and on the leaf surface (RHL), wind speed (u3) and direction at 3 m, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), LAI, and incoming shortwave radiation (Rs) were measured for a subsurface drip-irrigated non stressed maize canopy. The relationship between rs and Ta, TL, Tc, RHa, VPD, Rs, u3, and wind direction are presented. On a seasonal average basis, the J-model and the NMJ-model had similar performance in estimating rs (r 2 = 0.74, RMSD = 48.8 sm -1 for the J-model; and r 2 = 0.74, RMSD = 50.1 sm -1 for the NMJ-model; RMSD = root mean square difference between modeled and measured Rs). The inclusion of the variation in the LAI and r s-min term (r s-min exp(-LAI)) during the growing season in the NMJ-model improved the rs estimates, especially in the higher rs range (rs > 250 s m -1), as compared with the J-model. When the period for only partial canopy cover is considered, when LAI ranged from 1.20 to approximately 2.5, the addition of the LAI term in the NMJ-model resulted in 8% improvement in r 2 and 10% improvement in RMSD relative to the J-model (r 2 = 0.64, RMSD = 35.5 s m -1 for the NMJ model; and r 2 = 0.59, RMSD = 39.0 sm -1 for the J-model) when estimating rs. The estimated rs using T L rather than Ta correlated very well with the measured values, but with a slight decrease in performance for both the J model and the NMJ-model. Overall, the performance of the J-model and the NMJ-model decreased by 17% when T L rather than T a was used to estimate rs as compared with the measured rs. While the results demonstrated the superior performance of the NMJ-model over the J-model, especially during the partial canopy conditions, its performance needs further investigation and validation in other climatic settings.

abstract = {Accurate measurement of snowfall is crucial to meteorology, climate and hydrology research. A comparison of two automated snowfall gauges and a manual gauge was conducted in the winter of 2005-2006 at St. Denis National Wildlife Area, south-central Saskatchewan. The automated gauges tested were the Geonor T-200B and Campbell Scientific Canada TE525 Tipping Bucket gauge with CS705 snow fall adaptor. Both gauges were equipped with Alter-shields and compared to a Nipher reference gauge to estimate gauge catch efficiency. The Nipher was calibrated to 'true' snowfall by WMO standard equations. During the snowfall periods a variety of storm sizes was observed, with all wind speeds less than 7 m s-1. The results provided a mean calculated snowfall catch efficiency on an event basis (gauge to true) of 0.60 for the Geonor with Alter shield, and 0.40 for the Tipping Bucket with Alter-shield.. Cumulative seasonal efficiencies were higher, being 0.78 for the Geonor and 0.66 for the and the Tipping Bucket gauge. A relationship between catch efficiency and wind speed was developed for the Geonor.},

abstract = {Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30–40% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow‐cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land‐surface data to flag snow‐cloud identification errors and improve snow‐map accuracy reducing bias by 20% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow‐mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow‐dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow‐covered areas. Plain Language Summary Mapping snow cover extent informs water resources stored in the winter snowpack, providing important information for planning how and when to utilize available water. Tree canopies shield the forest floor and hinder the determination of snow‐covered area in vegetated terrain from above, where satellites view the Earth's surface. Moreover, satellites that scan the surface (like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) are most often not directly overhead, and as the view from the satellite to the surface slants, trees obscure a greater portion of the land surface that a satellite can “see,” especially where trees are tall, adding uncertainty to the satellite‐based maps. This effect is greatest in forests where 30–40% of the land area is covered by tree canopy and has little effect in very dense forests where most of the forest floor is obscured already. Here we present a method to accommodate the stretched and hidden forest footprint when a satellite is not directly overhead. A new method for identifying snow‐mapping errors caused by clouds is also presented by flagging unusually large changes in the non‐snow surfaces over sequential images. These methodological advancements are important because snow‐melt water comprises a major portion of the water supply in many regions where humans live. Key Points The canopy correction methodology improves remotely sensed snow mapping accuracy in forested environments, reducing bias by 20% A novel cloud detection algorithm that uses fractional vegetation and rock coverage can reduce snow‐cloud identification errors Improved performance over previous snow mapping approaches enable melt out date identification within days of actual snow disappearance},

abstract = {A mathematical model of subsurface flow is used to complement a field study of snowmelt runoff in a small upstream source area in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho. Field measurements from an instrumented cross section of this small watershed show that the mechanism of streamflow generation is subsurface delivery of meltwater over limited distances through shallow high‐permeability low‐porosity formations of altered and fractured basalt. The mathematical model provides a two‐dimensional transient saturated‐unsaturated analysis of the subsurface flow at the field site. It proved to be a valuable aid to a unified interpretation of the field measurements. For mathematical models that consist of boundary value problems with boundary conditions that are time and space dependent, the boundary condition sensitivity can thwart the rational calibration‐validation procedure. This, together with the more serious limitations of data availability, funds for data acquisition, and computer capacity, precludes the imminent use of fully deterministic hydrologic response models on a regional scale.},

Here we contrast surface climatic and radiative parameters measured in central Europe over different time periods, including the extreme summer 2003, to pinpoint the role of individual radiative forcings in temperature increases. Interestingly, surface solar radiation rather decreases since 1981. Also, on an annual basis no net radiative cooling or warming is observed under changing cloud amounts. However, high correlation (rT = 0.86) to increasing temperature is found with total heating radiation at the surface, and very high correlation (rT = 0.98) with cloud‐free longwave downward radiation. Preponderance of longwave downward radiative forcing suggests rapidly increasing greenhouse warming, which outweighs the decreasing solar radiation measured at the surface and drives rapid temperature increases over land.},

abstract = {During Holocene advances of the Bear River Glacier, in northwestern British Columbia, ice pushed against a bedrock slope on the north side of Bear River Pass as it was being diverted eastward and westward along the pass. The result is a series of till sheets plastered against the rock slope and separated by wood mats. This sequence of tills provides an unusually detailed record of early-Neoglacial history and shows that Neoglacial expansion in the northern Coast Mountains began earlier than previously known. Moraines show the extent of ‘Little Ice Age' expansion, and documents related to the long mining history of the area provide records of post-LIA recession. The oldest deposits in the area are a small lateral moraine outside of a prominent LIA moraine, and a till in the pass older than c. 3500 14C yr BP. The small moraine is undated; it may be equivalent to the latest-Pleistocene Crowfoot Advance which produced similar moraines in the southern Coast Mountains and eastern Cordillera. Wood mats in the pass show that Neoglacial advances occurred at c. 3700, 3500, 3300, and 1000 14C yr BP; each advance was slightly more extensive than the previous one. Documentary evidence indicates that the pass was still filled with ice in 1913, and diverging both eastward and westward, but glacier retreat has been rapid since then. Retreat from the pass in the mid-20th century resulted in the creation of Strohn Lake, through which meltwater from the glacier passes; a complicated lake history includes switching of discharge from eastward to westward and a series of jokuhlaups that damaged highway infrastructure to the west. A comparison of the history recorded at Bear River Pass with that recorded at the Todd Icefield 15 km to the north shows that different components of glacial history are preserved in different places, and many sites need to be examined to obtain a relatively complete regional history.},

Four different approaches (Monteith, Katerji-Perrier, Todorovic, and Jarvis) were used to estimate canopy resistance and, then after, crop evapotranspiration by PM equation were evaluated. The comparison was made to daily crop evapotranspiration obtained from the soil water balance (SWB) and soil water content variation measured by time domain reflectometry (TDR). The cumulative crop evapotranspiration of SWB, Monteith, Katerji-Perrier, Todorovic and Jarvis approach was respectively, 260.4, 266.8, 252.8, 263.4, 256 mm for the year 2013, and 250.5, 257.7, 240.6, 251.8, 247.6 mm for the year 2014.

abstract = {At high latitudes, longwave radiation can provide similar, or higher, amounts of energy to snow than shortwave radiation due to the low solar elevation (cosine effect and increased scattering due to long atmospheric path lengths). This effect is magnified in mountains due to shading and longwave emissions from the complex topography. This study examines longwave irradiance at the snow surface in the Wolf Creek Research Basin, Yukon Territory, Canada (60° 36′N, 134° 57′W) during the springs of 2002 and 2004. Incoming longwave radiation was estimated from standard meteorological measurements by segregating radiation sources into clear sky, clouds and surrounding terrain. A sensitivity study was conducted to detect the atmospheric and topographic conditions under which emission from adjacent terrain significantly increases the longwave irradiance. The total incoming longwave radiation is more sensitive to sky view factor than to the temperature of the emitting terrain surfaces. Brutsaert's equation correctly simulates the clear‐sky irradiance for hourly time steps using temperature and humidity. Longwave emissions from clouds, which raised longwave radiation above that from clear skies by 16% on average, were best estimated using daily atmospheric shortwave transmissivity and hourly relative humidity. An independent test of the estimation procedure for a prairie site near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, indicated that the calculations are robust in late winter and spring conditions.

abstract = {Rain‐on‐snow (ROS) is the primary generator of peak flow events in mountainous coastal regions of North America. Uncertainty remains as to the role of forest canopy interception leading up to and during ROS events. Much of this uncertainty can be attributed to a lack of suitable techniques to collect data during ROS, due in part to the dynamic nature of climatic conditions, particularly related to snow accumulation and melt. We supplemented a meteorological network with non‐weighing snow melt lysimeters, suspended spring scales to measure snow throughfall and an automated time lapse photography network to monitor state of precipitation (rain vs. snow), snow accumulation/ablation, canopy interception and unloading of snow from the canopy. Image analysis software allowed for the extraction of data from images. Rapid loading and unloading of snow from the canopy, closely linked to changes in temperature, was observed using this approach. We were also able to continuously monitor throughfall snow water equivalent using low cost suspended spring scales. This experimental design allowed us to capture information previously unavailable without direct observation. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope ($\delta$18O) measurements of authigenic carbonate from Cleland Lake (southeastern British Columbia), Paradise Lake (central British Columbia), and Lime Lake (eastern Washington) provide a $\sim$9000 year Holocene record of precipitation-evaporation balance variations in the Pacific Northwest. Both Cleland Lake and Paradise Lake are small, surficially closed-basin systems with no active inflows or outflows. Lime Lake is surficially open with a seasonally active overflow. Water isotope values from Cleland and Paradise plot along the local evaporation line, indicating that precipitation-evaporation balance is a strong influence on lake hydrology. In contrast, Lime Lake water isotope values plot on the local meteoric water line, signifying minimal influence by evaporation. To infer past hydrologic balance variations at a high temporal resolution, we sampled the Cleland, Paradise, and Lime Lake sediment cores at 1-60 mm intervals ($\sim$3-33 years per sample on average) and measured the isotopic composition of fine-grained (<63 $\mu$m) authigenic CaCO3 in each sample. Negative $\delta$18O values, which indicate wetter conditions in closed-basin lakes, occur in Cleland Lake sediment from 7600 to 2200 years before present (yr BP), and are followed by more positive $\delta$18O values, which suggest drier conditions, after 2200 yr BP. Highly negative $\delta$18O values in the Cleland Lake record centered on $\sim$2400 yr BP suggest that lake levels were high (and that the lake may have been overflowing) at this time as a result of a substantially wetter climate. Similarly, Paradise Lake sediment $\delta$18O values are relatively low from 7600 to 4000 yr BP and increase from $\sim$4000 to 3000 yr BP and from $\sim$2000 yr BP to present, indicating that climate became drier from the middle through the late Holocene. The $\delta$18O record from Lime Lake, which principally reflects changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation, exhibits less variability than the closed-basin lake records and follows a generally increasing trend from the mid-Holocene to present. These results are consistent with several proximal reconstructions of changes in lake-level, precipitation amount, and precipitation isotopic composition and may also reflect the establishment of modern El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in the late Holocene, as inferred from proxy evidence of synoptic ocean-atmosphere changes in the Pacific basin. Results from mid-Holocene (6000 yr BP) climate model simulations conducted as part of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3) indicate that in much of western North America, the cold season (October-March) was wetter and the warm season (April-September) was considerably drier relative to the late Holocene, leading to an overall drier climate in western North America with enhanced hydroclimatic seasonality. This is consistent with inferences from the Cleland and Paradise $\delta$18O records, which lake modeling experiments indicate are strongly influenced by cold season precipitation-evaporation balance. This also explains apparent inconsistencies between the lake $\delta$18O records and other proxies of hydroclimatic change from the greater Pacific Northwest region that are less sensitive to cold season climate and thus indicate relatively drier conditions during the mid-Holocene. The abrupt negative excursion at $\sim$2400 yr BP in the Cleland Lake $\delta$18O data, as well as the marked shift to more positive values after this time, demonstrate that gradual changes in ocean-atmosphere dynamics can produce abrupt, non-linear hydroclimate responses in the interior regions of western North America.},

Comparison with evaporation determined by a combination method with two different estimates of aerodynamic resistance (the “standard” rain aerodynamic resistance r aL and a snow aerodynamic resistance r aS—an order of magnitude larger than r aL) showed that r aL overestimated the evaporation by a factor of 2.6, whereas r aS gave fair agreement with the measured evaporation.

abstract = {Vegetation has a tremendous influence on snow processes and snowpack dynamics, yet remote sensing techniques to resolve the spatial variability of sub-canopy snow depth are not always available and are difficult from spacebased platforms. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have had recent widespread application to capture high-resolution information on snow processes and are herein applied to the sub-canopy snow depth challenge. Previous demonstrations of snow depth mapping with UAV structure from motion (SfM) and airborne lidar have focussed on non-vegetated surfaces or reported large errors in the presence of vegetation. In contrast, UAV-lidar systems have high-density point clouds and measure returns from a wide range of scan angles, increasing the likelihood of successfully sensing the subcanopy snow depth. The effectiveness of UAV lidar and UAV SfM in mapping snow depth in both open and forested terrain was tested in a 2019 field campaign at the Canadian Rockies Hydrological Observatory, Alberta, and at Canadian prairie sites near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Only UAV lidar could successfully measure the sub-canopy snow surface with reliable sub-canopy point coverage and consistent error metrics (root mean square error (RMSE) <0:17 m and bias-0:03 to-0:13 m). Relative to UAV lidar, UAV SfM did not consistently sense the sub-canopy snow surface, the interpolation needed to account for point cloud gaps introduced interpolation artefacts, and error metrics demonstrated relatively large variability (RMSE<0:33 m and bias 0.08 to-0:14 m). With the demonstration of sub-canopy snow depth mapping capabilities, a number of early applications are presented to showcase the ability of UAV lidar to effectively quantify the many multiscale snow processes defining snowpack dynamics in mountain and prairie environments.},

abstract = {Hector Lake, situated in the eastern Rocky Mountains of western Alberta, is fed primarily by nival and glacial meltwater. During summer when the lake is thermally stratified, inflowing water and fine sediment enter the lake as overflows and shallow interflows that are transformed into complex, but mostly downlake, epilimnial currents generated by downlake katabatic winds. Coriolis deflections produce a strong right-hand tendency in sedimentation patterns, with resulting crosslake (south-to-north) as well as downlake (west-to-east) proximal–distal trends: reduction in grain size, sedimentation rates, total carbonate, dolomite/(dolomite + calcite) and varve thickness.Laminae in bottom sediments are produced by inflow variations that are largely dependent upon air temperature. Five orders of inflow, and thus sediment input, variation capable of producing laminae are recognized: diurnal, subseasonal (short-term weather changes), seasonal (nival melt vs. glacial melt), annual and exceptional inflow events.

Advanced remote sensing technologies provide data to assist in addressing these escalating information needs and to support the subsequent development and parameterization of models for an even broader range of information needs. This special issue contains papers that use a variety of remote sensing technologies to derive forest inventory or inventory-related information. Herein, we review the potential of 4 advanced remote sensing technologies, which we posit as having the greatest potential to influence forest inventories designed to characterize forest resource information for strategic, tactical, and operational planning: airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), and high spatial resolution (HSR)/very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite optical imagery. ALS, in particular, has proven to be a transformative technology, offering forest inventories the required spatial detail and accuracy across large areas and a diverse range of forest types. The coupling of DAP with ALS technologies will likely have the greatest impact on forest inventory practices in the next decade, providing capacity for a broader suite of attributes, as well as for monitoring growth over time.},

abstract = {Sediment records from proglacial lakes between 9 and 10°S in the western Cordillera of the Peruvian Andes document the waxing and waning of alpine glaciers since the end of the Lateglacial stage. These records from the southern tropical Andes provide supporting evidence that the early Holocene (between 12 and 8ka) was relatively warm and dry, and the middle Holocene (between 8 and 4ka) was marked by a shift to cooler, and possibly wetter conditions in certain regions, leading to glacial advances. Although there were multiple periods of brief ice advances that interrupted the overall trend, glaciers in multiple valleys generally retreated from $\sim$4.0ka through the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1.0-0.7ka). This late Holocene pattern of ice retreat occurred during a period when lake level studies, and both lacustrine and speleothem stable isotopic records indicate wetter conditions relative to the middle Holocene, suggesting that higher temperatures contributed to the pattern of ice retreat. Following this period of glacial retreat, multiple proxy records suggest that the start of the Little Ice Age ($\sim$0.6-0.1ka) was a colder and wetter time throughout much of the tropical Andes. There appear to be two primary synoptic-scale climatic controls on temperature and precipitation linked to insolation dynamics that drive changes in ice cover in the southern tropical Andes during the Holocene: 1) the strength of the South America Summer Monsoon, which is linked to Northern Hemisphere temperatures and the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over the Atlantic, and 2) sea surface temperature distributions in the tropical Pacific Ocean and its influence on atmospheric temperature, precipitation and circulation patterns. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We present a novel process-based approach to diagnose model errors through an example that focuses on snow accumulation processes (precipitation partitioning, new snow density, and snow compaction). Twelve years of meteorological and snow board measurements were used to identify the main source of model error on each snow accumulation day. Results show that modeled values of new snow density were outside observational uncertainties in 52% of days available for evaluation, while precipitation partitioning and compaction were in error 45% and 16% of the time, respectively. Precipitation partitioning errors mattered more for total winter accumulation during the anomalously warm winter of 2014–2015, when a higher fraction of precipitation fell within the temperature range where partition methods had the largest error. These results demonstrate how isolating individual model processes can identify the primary source(s) of model error, which helps prioritize future research.},

abstract = {Sublimation is a critical component of the snow cover mass balance. Although sublimation can be directly measured using eddy covariance (EC), such measurements are relatively uncommon in complex mountainous environments. The EC measurements of surface snowpack sublimation from three consecutive winter seasons (2004, 2005 and 2006) at a wind-exposed and wind-sheltered site were analysed to characterise sublimation in mountainous terrain. During the 2006 snow season, snow surface and near-surface air temperature, humidity and wind were also measured, permitting the calculation of sublimation rates and a comparison with EC measurements. This comparison showed that measured and simulated sublimation was very similar at the exposed site but less so at the sheltered site. Wind speeds at the exposed site were nearly four times than that at the sheltered site, and the exposed site yielded measured sublimation that was two times the magnitude of that at the sheltered site. The time variation of measured sublimation showed diurnal increases in the early afternoon and increased rates overall as the snow season progressed. Measured mean daily sublimation rates were 0.39 and 0.15mmday-1 at the exposed and sheltered sites, respectively. At the exposed site, measured sublimation accounted for 16% and 41% of the maximum snow accumulation in 2006 and 2005, respectively. At the sheltered site, measured seasonal sublimation was approximately 4% in 2004 and 2006 and 8% in 2005 of the maximum snow water equivalent. Simulated sublimation was only available for 2006 and suggested smaller but comparable percentages to the sublimation estimated from observations. At the exposed site, a total of 42mm sublimated for the snow season, which constituted 12% of the maximum accumulation. At the sheltered site, 17mm (2.2% of maximum accumulation) was sublimated over the snow season. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Models of surface energy balance and snow metamorphism are utilized to predict the energy and meltwater fluxes at an Arctic site in the forest-tundra transition zone of north-western Canada. The surface energy balance during the melt period is modelled using an hourly bulk aerodynamic approach. Once a snowcover becomes patchy, advection from the bare patches to the snow-covered areas results in a large spatial variation in basin snowmelt. In order to illustrate the importance of small-scale, horizontal advection, a simple parameterization scheme using sensible heat fluxes from snow free areas was tested. This scheme estimates the maximum horizontal advection of sensible heat from the bare patches to the snow-covered areas. Calculated melt was routed through the measured snowcover in each landscape type using a variable flow path, meltwater percolation model. This allowed the determination of the spatial variability in the timing and magnitude of meltwater release for runoff. Model results indicate that the initial release of meltwater first occurred on the shallow upland tundra sites, but meltwater release did not occur until nearly two weeks later on the deep drift snowcovers. During these early periods of melt, not all meltwater is available for runoff. Instead, there is a period when some snowpacks are only partially contributing to runoff, and the spatial variation of runoff contribution corresponds to landscape type. Comparisons of melt with and without advection suggests that advection is an important process controlling the timing of basin snowmelt.},

abstract = {The study was carried out at the experimental farm of the Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, having a sub-humid climate. A weighing type lysimeter of 75 cm diameter and 75 cm height was installed at the center of a 10 m × 10 m experimental plot and daily reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) was measured with an electronic datalogger connected to the lysimeter. Grass was used as the reference crop for observing the actual ET. A total of 10 climatological methods were selected for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration on a daily basis. Some of these methods are based on combination theory and others are empirical methods based primarily on solar radiation, temperature and relative humidity. All the methods were originally developed for a well watered reference crop, either alfalfa or grass. An attempt was made in the current study to develop regional relationships between the evapotranspiration measured by the lysimeter and that estimated by the climatological methods, such as Penman, FAO-Penman, FAO-Corrected-Penman, 1982-Kimberley-Penman, Penman-Monteith, Turc-Radiation, Priestley-Taylor, FAO-Radiation, Hargreaves and FAO-Blaney-Criddle. Performance of the climatological methods in estimating the ETo values as compared to the lysimeter-measured values was evaluated on the basis of root mean square error (RMSE). Almost all combination methods performed quite well. Radiation methods also gave good results but the ETo values estimated by these methods did not match closely with the measured ETo values unlike those estimated by the combination methods. The Penman-Monteith equation gave the best result followed by 1982-Kimberly-Penman, FAO-Penman, Turc-Radiation and FAO-Blaney-Criddle. The RMSE in all the cases varied between 0.08 and 0.756. Crop-coefficients (Kc) were estimated for potato crop at different stages of growth, at the same location, based on lysimeter measured actual ET and the reference crop evapotranspiration estimated by various methods. The measured values of crop-coefficient for potato crop at four stages of growth, such as initial, crop development, reproductive and maturity were 0.42, 0.85, 1.27 and 0.57, respectively. The Kc value at the maturity stage was found to be considerably higher than the corresponding FAO recommended Kc value. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Annually-laminated lake sediments (non-glacial varves) have in recent years been discovered in increasing abundance, especially since the development of in situ freezer samplers. So far, the majority of examples have been found in three main areas (Eastern North America, Northern and Central Europe, and East and Central Africa). A much more widespread distribution seems highly probable however. The formation of annual laminations in freshwater lakes is governed by a number of factors, the most important of which appears to be morphometry. Seasonality of sediment supply, which may be controlled by physical, biological or even cultural processes in the lake, or in its catchment, is also clearly significant. Four main types of laminations (here termed ferrogenic, calcareous, biogenic and clastic) have so far been recorded, although it is quite clear that others exist. Special field and laboratory techniques are needed in order that the particular properties of varved sediments may be fully exploited. Annually-laminated sediments have so far been applied to the investigation of a number of aspects of the Quaternary. These include the study of (a) geochronology (b) climatic change, (c) vegetation history, especially the role of fire in forest ecosystems, (d) the calculation of rates of sediment influx to lakes, and of rates of erosion from their catchments, and (e) the monitoring of processes in the modern environment such as heavy metal pollution, eutrophication, and 'acid rain'. Annually-laminated lake sediments combine an internal, independent chronology with the preservation of discrete, visible increments of seasonal and annual sedimentation. Given this unique property, and the likelihood that many more examples will be discovered, the prospects for further applications of studies of these sediments to the investigation of the Quaternary seem very good indeed. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {[Display omitted] •Traditional canopy models failed to predict irradiance patterns in a forest gap.•A new raytrace model of solar irradiance in gaps was evaluated against measurements.•The new model reduced biases of existing approaches from ±90Wm−2 to <4Wm−2.•The sensitivity of clear-sky irradiance to latitude, date and gap size was examined. Solar irradiance in and around forest gaps plays a key role in determining the snowmelt patterns that shape how forest gaps influence spring snow cover retention relative to open or continuously forested landscapes. To reduce uncertainty in forest gap snowmelt estimation, a new canopy solar transmittance model was developed to include the effects of shading and enhanced transmittance. The model couples a new a ray tracing approach with an existing canopy solar radiation extinction and transmission model. The new model analytically solves for the path length of a solar ray (beam) through a forest canopy and potential intersection(s) with a forest gap conceptualized as an upright circular cylinder surrounded by homogeneous forest. The model was tested alongside simpler transmittance models that ignored shading and treated the canopy as either a binary (open or forested) classification or that used proximal canopy descriptors. The models were evaluated using measurements of shortwave radiation from 20 pyranometers in and around a 56 m diameter gap in a coniferous forest. Errors from ignoring shading were greatest in the gap near the forest edge and in the forest nearest the northern gap edge. The new model reduced these errors; at the 20 pyranometer locations, individual biases up to +356Wm−2 and average biases up to +101Wm−2 were reduced to better than ±5Wm−2. Results suggest that an accurate description of spatial variability of solar irradiance in and around a forest gap requires explicit treatment of the effects of shading into a gap and enhanced transmittance beyond the gap extent; this is dependent upon solar position, gap and forest geometry, and location relative to the gap. A sensitivity experiment with the forest gap – ray trace model in which gap size, latitude, and day of year were varied under clear-sky conditions showed that cumulative daily solar irradiance has high spatiotemporal variability. The maximum of the spatial coefficient of variation (CV) of cumulative daily irradiance was a function of gap size and solar angles; smaller (larger) gaps and lower (higher) solar elevation angle ranges were more diffuse- (direct beam-) dominated with reduced (increased) spatial variability relative to the mean. It is found that there is no standard impact of a forest gap on shortwave irradiance – the impact of gap size on clear sky solar irradiance depends on forest structure, date, and latitude.},

abstract = {This paper presents the issues in snow water equivalent (SWE) determination using acoustic reflectometry. To determine SWE, the density and the depth of each layer of snow in a snow pack need to be estimated. A noninvasive acoustic reflectometry technique to estimate the SWE is proposed in the mentioned paper, in which it is shown that SWE of the snowpacks with approximately 100 cm depth can be determined using a maximum length sequence (MLS) of length 7 as a probe signal. We performed similar experiments as reported in the mentioned paper to determine SWE using acoustic reflectometry but failed to replicate the given method. The signal processing-related issues such as design of probe signal, direct pickup problem, and so on of the mentioned paper are investigated and presented in this communication. We show that it is not possible to extract the reflection response by using the MLS of length 7 as a probe signal. The amount of sound attenuation and absorption in the snow medium is very high, of the order of 1 dB/cm and greater depending on the frequency, as reported in the literature and measured by us. Hence, the depth of snowpack investigated in the mentioned paper is practically difficult to achieve using conventional loudspeaker and microphone. Also, it has been explained how the cross-correlation peak width and, hence, the layer resolution achieved by the authors of the mentioned paper is not practically feasible by their reported method. We have also demonstrated that Wiener spiking deconvolution-based technique is not able to obtain the sharp peaks as shown in the mentioned paper.},

@article{Vionnet2020,
abstract = {From 19 to 22 June 2013, intense rainfall and concurrent snowmelt led to devastating floods in the Canadian Rockies, foothills and downstream areas of southern Alberta and southeastern British Columbia, Canada. Such an event is typical of late-spring floods in cold-region mountain headwater, combining intense precipitation with rapid melting of late-lying snowpack, and represents a challenge for hydrological forecasting systems. This study investigated the factors governing the ability to predict such an event. Three sources of uncertainty, other than the hydrological model processes and parameters, were considered: (i) the resolution of the atmospheric forcings, (ii) the snow and soil moisture initial conditions (ICs) and (iii) the representation of the soil texture. The Global Environmental Multiscale hydrological modeling platform (GEM-Hydro), running at a 1&thinsp;km grid spacing, was used to simulate hydrometeorological conditions in the main headwater basins of southern Alberta during this event. The GEM atmospheric model and the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) system were combined to generate atmospheric forcing at 10, 2.5 and 1&thinsp;km over southern Alberta. Gridded estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) from the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) were used to replace the model SWE at peak snow accumulation and generate alternative snow and soil moisture ICs before the event. Two global soil texture datasets were also used. Overall 12 simulations of the flooding event were carried out. Results show that the resolution of the atmospheric forcing affected primarily the flood volume and peak flow in all river basins due to a more accurate estimation of intensity and total amount of precipitation during the flooding event provided by CaPA analysis at convection-permitting scales (2.5 and 1&thinsp;km). Basin-averaged snowmelt also changed with the resolution due to changes in near-surface wind and resulting turbulent fluxes contributing to snowmelt. Snow ICs were the main sources of uncertainty for half of the headwater basins. Finally, the soil texture had less impact and only affected peak flow magnitude and timing for some stations. These results highlight the need to combine atmospheric forcing at convection-permitting scales with high-quality snow ICs to provide accurate streamflow predictions during late-spring floods in cold-region mountain river basins. The predictive improvement by inclusion of high-elevation weather stations in the precipitation analysis and the need for accurate mountain snow information suggest the necessity of integrated observation and prediction systems for forecasting extreme events in mountain river basins.},

abstract = {In the companion to the present paper, the soil model associated with CLASS (Canadian Land Surface Scheme) was outlined. In this paper, the accompanying vegetation model is described. This model includes physically based treatment of energy and moisture fluxes from the canopy as well as radiation and precipitation cascades through it, and incorporates explicit thermal separation of the vegetation from the underlying ground. Seasonal variations of canopy parameters are accounted for. The morphological characteristics of the ‘composite canopy' associated with each grid square are calculated as weighted averages over the vegetation types present. Each grid square is divided into a maximum of four separate subareas: bare soil, snow‐covered, vegetation‐covered, and snow‐and‐vegetation covered. Test runs were done in coupled mode with the Canadian Climate Centre GCM, to evaluate the performance of CLASS compared with that of the simpler land surface scheme previously used. Two versions of CLASS were run: one with ponded surface water saved between time steps, and one with it discarded. For the seasons of June—July—August and December—January—February, diagnostic calculations showed that the old scheme underestimated the globally averaged land surface screen temperature by as much as 3.0°C, and overestimated the globally averaged precipitation rate over land by up to 1.0 mm day−1. CLASS, on the other hand, produced screen temperature anomalies, varying in sign, of 0.2–0.3°C, and positive precipitation anomalies of 0.6–0.7 mm day−1. The relatively poor performance of the old model was attributed to its neglect of vegetation stomatal resistance, its assumption that the contents of the soil moisture ‘bucket' had to be completely frozen before the surface temperature could fall below 0°C, and its use of the force‐restore method for soil temperatures, which systematically neglects long‐term thermal forcing from the soil substrate. The assumption made in most GCMs that excess surface water immediately becomes overland runoff is shown to result in substantial overestimates of surface screen temperatures in continental interiors.},

abstract = {A warm, very wet Paci{\textregistered}c storm caused signi{\textregistered}cant ¯ooding in the Paci{\textregistered}c Northwest during February 1996. Rapid melting of the mountain snow cover contributed to this ¯ooding. An energy balance snowmelt model is used to simulate snowmelt processes during this event in the Central Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Data from paired open and forested experimental sites at locations at and just below the Paci{\textregistered}c Crest were used to drive the model. The event was preceded by cold, stormy conditions that developed a signi{\textregistered}cant snow cover down to elevations as low as 500 m in the Oregon Cascades. At the start of the storm, the depth of the snow cover at the high site (1142 m) was 1. 97 m with a snow water equivalent (SWE) of 425 mm, while at the mid-site (968 m) the snow cover was 1. 14 m with a SWE of 264 mm. During the 5±6 day period of the storm the open high site received 349 mm of rain, lost 291 mm of SWE and generated 640 mm of runo, leaving only 0. 22 m of snow on the ground. The mid-site received 410 mm of rain, lost 264 mm of SWE to melt and generated 674 mm of runo, completely depleting the snow cover. Simulations at adjacent forested sites showed signi{\textregistered}cantly less snowmelt during the event. The snow cover under the mature forest at the high site lost only 44 mm of SWE during the event, generating 396 mm of runo and leaving 0. 69 m of snow. The model accurately simulated both snow cover depth and SWE during the development of the snow cover prior to the storm, and the depletion of the snow cover during the event. This analysis shows that because of the high temperature, humidity and relatively high winds in the open sites during the storm, 60±90% of the energy for snowmelt came from sensible and latent heat exchanges. Because the antecedent conditions extended the snow cover to very low elevations in the basin, snowmelt generated by condensation during the event made a signi{\textregistered}cant contribution to the ¯ood. Lower wind speeds beneath the forest canopy during the storm reduced the magnitude of the turbulent exchanges at the snow surface, so the contribution of snowmelt to the runo from forested areas was signi{\textregistered}cantly less. This experiment shows the sensitivity of snowmelt processes to both climate and land cover, and illustrates how the forest canopy is coupled to the hydrological cycle in mountainous areas. #},

abstract = {We measured the surface energy budget of an Alpine grassland in highly complex terrain to explore possibilities and limitations for application of the eddy-covariance technique, also for CO 2 flux measurements, at such non-ideal locations. This paper focuses on the influence of complex terrain on the turbulent energy measurements of a characteristic high Alpine grassland on Crap Alv (Alp Weissenstein) in the Swiss Alps during the growing season 2006. Measurements were carried out on a topographic terrace with a slope of 25 ◦ inclination. Flux data quality is assessed via the closure of the energy budget and the quality flag method used within the CarboEurope project. During 93% of the time the wind direction was along the main valley axis (43% upvalley and 50% downvalley directions). During the transition times of the typical twice daily wind direction changes in a mountain valley the fraction of high and good quality flux data reached a minimum of ≈50%, whereas during the early afternoon ≈70% of all records yielded good to highest quality (CarboEurope flags 0 and 1). The overall energy budget closure was 74 ± 2%. An angular correction for the shortwave energy input to the slope improved the energy budget closure slightly to 82 ± 2% for afternoon conditions. In the daily total, the measured turbulent energy fluxes are only underestimated by around 8% of net radiation. In summary, our results suggest that it is possible to yield realistic energy flux measurements under such conditions. We thus argue that the Crap Alv site and similar topographically complex locations with short-statured vegetation should be well suited also for CO 2 flux measurements.},

abstract = {We summarize evidence of the latest Pleistocene and Holocene glacier fluctuations in the Canadian Cordillera. Our review focuses primarily on studies completed after 1988, when the first comprehensive review of such evidence was published. The Cordilleran ice sheet reached its maximum extent about 16 ka and then rapidly decayed. Some lobes of the ice sheet, valley glaciers, and cirque glaciers advanced one or more times between 15 and 11 ka. By 11 ka, or soon thereafter, glacier cover in the Cordillera was no more extensive than at the end of the 20th century. Glaciers were least extensive between 11 and 7 ka. A general expansion of glaciers began as early as 8.4 ka when glaciers overrode forests in the southern Coast Mountains; it culminated with the climactic advances of the Little Ice Age. Holocene glacier expansion was not continuous, but rather was punctuated by advances and retreats on a variety of timescales. Radiocarbon ages of wood collected from glacier forefields reveal six major periods of glacier advance: 8.59-8.18, 7.36-6.45, 4.40-3.97, 3.54-2.77, 1.71-1.30 ka, and the past millennium. Tree-ring and lichenometric dating shows that glaciers began their Little Ice Age advances as early as the 11th century and reached their maximum Holocene positions during the early 18th or mid-19th century. Our data confirm a previously suggested pattern of episodic but successively greater Holocene glacier expansion from the early Holocene to the climactic advances of the Little Ice Age, presumably driven by decreasing summer insolation throughout the Holocene. Proxy climate records indicate that glaciers advanced during the Little Ice Age in response to cold conditions that coincided with times of sunspot minima. Priority research required to further advance our understanding of late Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation in western Canada includes constraining the age of late Pleistocene moraines in northern British Columbia and Yukon Territory, expanding the use of cosmogenic surface exposure dating techniques, using multi-proxy paleoclimate approaches, and directing more of the research effort to the northern Canadian Cordillera. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Nutt.), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.). Analysis of these and other reported measurements confirmed (i) snow bridging by cohesion, (ii) bouncing of snow crystals by elastic rebound, and (iii) branch bending as mechanisms that determine the sigmoidal growth curves characterizing snow interception relative to snowfall. The fraction of snowfall intercepted by the branches was largest when storm accumulations were 3-4 mm water equivalent, with low specific gravity (0.04-0.07). Percent catch in snowfalls with 10 mm water and low specific gravity was near 50% for Engelmann spruce and about 45% for subalpine fir and lodgepole pine, but values decreased to near 30% in 20-mm storms. Catch was inversely proportional to the density of snow accumulations in the specific gravity range 0.04-0.13. Average branch catch was only about 10% of a storm with 10 mm water equivalent at 0.13 specific gravity. Meteorological conditions were more important than branch growth form in determining snow interception amounts on the conifers tested. The results suggest, as a hypothesis, a computational function for the fraction of snowfall caught on conifer crowns.},

abstract = {In this study we report the sediment grain size parameters and surface textural observations (using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) of quartz grains from sediments of Sandy Lake, Schirmacher Oasis, East Antarctica. The sediment core spans the last 43 cal ka B.P. The statistical parameters of grain size data (sorting, skewness, kurtosis, mean grain size, D10, D50, D90and SPAN index) indicate that the sediments are primarily transported by melt-water streams and glaciers. However, during the last glacial period, sediments seem to be transported due to wind activity as evident by the good correlation between rounded quartz data and dust flux data from EPICA ice-core data. The mean grain size values are low during the last glacial period indicating colder climatic conditions and the values increase after the last glacial maximum suggesting an increase in the energy of the transporting medium, i.e., melt-water streams. The sediments are poorly sorted and finely skewed and show different modes of grain size distribution throughout the last 43 cal ka B.P. SEM studies of selected quartz grains and analyses of various surface textures indicate that glacigenic conditions must have prevailed at the time of their transport. Semi-quantitative analyses of mineral (quartz, feldspar, mica, garnet and rock fragments & other minerals) counts suggest a mixed population of minerals with quartz being the dominant mineral. Higher concentration of quartz grains over other minerals indicates that the sediments are compositionally mature. The study reveals the different types of physical weathering, erosive signatures, and chemical precipitation most of them characteristic of glacial environment which affected these quartz grains before final deposition as lake sediments. The palaeoclimatic signals obtained from this study show similarities with ice-core and lake sediment records from Schirmacher Oasis and other ice-free regions in East Antarctica.},

abstract = {Snow interception is a crucial hydrological process in cold regions needleleaf forests, but is rarely measured directly. Indirect estimates of snow interception can be made by measuring the difference in the increase in snow accumulation between the forest floor and a nearby clearing over the course of a storm. Pairs of automatic weather stations with acoustic snow depth sensors provide an opportunity to estimate this, if snow density can be estimated reliably. Three approaches for estimating fresh snow density were investigated: weighted post-storm density increments from the physically based Snobal model, fresh snow density estimated empirically from air temperature (Hedstrom, N. R., et al. [1998]. Hydrological Processes, 12, 1611–1625), and fresh snow density estimated empirically from air temperature and wind speed (Jordan, R. E., et al. [1999]. Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, 7785–7806). Automated snow depth observations from adjacent forest and clearing sites and estimated snow densities were used to determine snowstorm snow interception in a subalpine forest in the Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada. Then the estimated snow interception and measured interception information from a weighed, suspended tree and a time-lapse camera were assimilated into a model, which was created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM), using Ensemble Kalman Filter or a simple rule-based direct insertion method. Interception determined using density estimates from the Hedstrom-Pomeroy fresh snow density equation agreed best with observations. Assimilating snow interception information from automatic snow depth measurements improved modelled snow interception timing by 7% and magnitude by 13%, compared to an open loop simulation driven by a numerical weather model; its accuracy was close to that simulated using locally observed meteorological data. Assimilation of tree-measured snow interception improved the snow interception simulation timing and magnitude by 18 and 19%, respectively. Time-lapse camera snow interception information assimilation improved the snow interception simulation timing by 32% and magnitude by 7%. The benefits of assimilation were greatly influenced by assimilation frequency and quality of the forcing data.},

New algorithms, developed by the authors, for estimating snow interception in forest canopies, blowing snow transport and sublimation, snow cover depletion and open environment snowmelt are compared with field measurements. Existing algorithms are discussed and compared with field observations. Recommendations are made with respect to: (a) density of new and aged snow in open and forest environments; (b) interception of snow by evergreen canopies; (c) redistribution and sublimation of snow water equivalent by blowing snow; (d) depletion in snow-covered area during snowmelt; (e) albedo decay during snowmelt; (f) turbulent transfer during snowmelt; and (g) soil heat flux during meltwater infiltration into frozen soils. Preliminary evidence is presented, suggesting that one relatively advanced land surface model, CLASS, significantly underestimates the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt rates in open environments despite overestimating radiation and turbulent contributions to melt. The cause(s) may be due to overestimation of ground heat loss and other factors. It is recommended that further studies of snow energetics and soil heat transfer in frozen soils be undertaken to provide improvements for land surface models such as CLASS, with particular attention paid to establishing the reliability of the models in invoking closure of the energy equation.},

The heat conduction problem was treated in two ways. Local heat conduction between a snow grain and its surrounding water film was treated by using a simple energy balance. Global heat conduction with a phase change (the Stefan problem) was introduced to calculate the space‐time temperature distribution.

abstract = {A model including slope effects on snow redistribution, interception and energetics was developed using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model platform, parameterized with minimal calibration and manipulated to simulate the impacts of forest disturbance on mountain hydrology. A total of 40 forest disturbance scenarios were compared with the current land cover for four simulation years. Disturbance scenarios ranged from the impact of pine beetle kill of lodgepole pine to clear-cutting of north- or south-facing slopes, forest fire and salvage logging. Pine beetle impacts were small in all cases with increases in snowmelt volume of less than 10% and streamflow volume of less than 2%. This small impact is attributed to the low and relatively dry elevations of lodgepole pine forests in the basin. Forest disturbances due to fire and clear-cutting affected much larger areas and higher elevations of the basin and were generally more than twice as effective as pine beetle in increasing snowmelt or streamflow. For complete forest cover removal by burning and salvage logging, a 45% increase in snowmelt volume was simulated; however, this only translated into a 5% increase in spring and summer streamflow volume. Forest burning with the retention of standing burned trunks was the most effective forest cover treatment for increasing streamflow (up to 8%) because of its minimizing of winter snow sublimation losses from interception and blowing snow. However, increases in streamflow volumes were almost entirely due to reductions in intercepted snow sublimation with decreasing canopy coverage. Peak daily streamflow discharges responded more strongly to forest cover disturbance than did seasonal streamflow volumes, with increases of almost 25% in peak streamflow from the removal of forest canopy by fire and the retention of standing burned trunks. Peak flow was most effectively increased by forest removal on south-facing slopes and level sites. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Laser altimetry (lidar) is a remote-sensing technology that holds tremendous promise for mapping snow depth in snow hydrology and avalanche applications. Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.},

abstract = {The Medieval Warm Period is an interval of purportedly warm climate during the early part of the past millennium. The duration, areal extent, and even existence of the Medieval Warm Period have been debated; in some areas the climate of this interval appears to have been affected more by changes in precipitation than in temperature. Here, we provide new evidence showing that several glaciers in western North America advanced during Medieval time and that some glaciers achieved extents similar to those at the peak of the Little Ice Age, many hundred years later. The advances cannot be reconciled with a climate similar to that of the twentieth century, which has been argued to be an analog, and likely were the result of increased winter precipitation due to prolonged La Ni{\~{n}}a-like conditions that, in turn, may be linked to elevated solar activity. Changes in solar output may initiate a response in the tropical Pacific that directly impacts the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation and associated North Pacific teleconnections. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Estimates of evaporation from open water are increasingly required for several Environment Agency functions, particularly Water Resources and Ecology. These estimates are used mainly for water balance studies to support appraisals of applications for abstraction licences, in wetlands and still waters management. Current methods of estimating open water evaporation vary between and, in some cases, within Regions; there is no generally adopted best method. In addition, there is often a mismatch between the accuracy of estimates produced by current methods (they are generally crude and subject to large uncertainties) and their significance in the calculations that are used as a basis for decision making. There is therefore a need to review the Agency's requirements for estimating open water evaporation in relation to the methods and data available. The objectives of this project are: • evaluate current methods of estimating open water evaporation; • recommend the best available practicable methodologies for producing robust estimates; • assess the associated uncertainty of these methodologies The project consists of two Phases. Phase 1 essentially dealt with the first two objectives and made recommendations for more quantified assessments of uncertainty that were carried out under Phase 2. A survey of Agency Regional staff in summer 1999 established that the Agency currently requires estimates of open water evaporation for three purposes: abstraction licensing, water balance studies and management of wetlands. Empirical factors applied to estimates of potential evaporation are used to produce these estimates in all Areas and Regions. However, the values of the factors and data sets of potential evaporation employed vary between Regions and may vary between Areas. Thus, although there is a consensus on the method, there is little on how it is operated. Significant errors, up to 30%, can occur when using the empirical factors method for estimating evaporation if inappropriate factors are used, e.g. if the empirical factors calibrated on values of potential evaporation calculated using one model are applied to values calculated using a different model. The review of methods of estimating open water evaporation identified seven methods; pan evaporation, mass balance, energy budget models, bulk transfer models, combination models, the equilibrium temperature approach and empirical factors. A ranking of the seven methods of estimating open water evaporation against nine criteria (covering accuracy, robustness, ease of use etc.) established that the equilibrium temperature approach would best serve the Agency's purposes. The use of empirical factors and the combination models were ranked equal second. The spatial variability of the meteorological variables that drive evaporation is strongly influenced by proximity to the coast. Inland, the spatial variability of wind speed and air temperature is low whilst incoming solar radiation and relative humidity show significantly more spatial variability. Topography has a strong effect on the driving variables, either directly, in terms of the lapse rates of air temperature and vapour pressure, or indirectly, through the formation of clouds affecting the amount of incoming solar radiation. R&D TECHNICAL REPORT W6-043/TR v Correcting for the effect of altitude on the driving variables can be achieved except for the effect of cloudiness on incoming solar radiation. Empirical corrections to evaporation estimates for altitude have also been found, and although this is not as physically rigorous as correcting the driving variables, the analysis indicated that the latter performed better. The size of the water body affects evaporation rates in two ways. Firstly, there is evidence that, for water surfaces greater than 10 m in diameter, the rate of evaporation over water is enhanced due to increased wind speed resulting from the smoother surface. However, no means of taking these effects into account has been found. Secondly, the size of the water body in England and Wales affects the development of thermal stratification. The maximum depth of the warmer surface layer is a function of the surface area of the water body. This can have a significant effect on open water evaporation. The methods recommended for use by Agency staff (equilibrium temperature and empirical factors) have been tested against measurements of evaporation made at Kempton Park between 1956 and 1962. The combination models of Penman (1948) and Penman-Monteith were included for the purposes of comparison. The results show that the estimates of open water evaporation made by the equilibrium temperature model are in excellent agreement with the measured values. Using the empirical factors of Penman (1948) with MORECS grass PE, reasonable agreement was achieved. Other methods performed poorly. The sensitivity of the estimates of open water evaporation made using the equilibrium temperature method to the parameters required has been carried out and values for these parameters have been recommended. Comparison between measured evaporation at Kempton Park reservoirs and the values predicted by the equilibrium temperature model suggest an accuracy of ± 2 % can be achieved for annual values and ± 30 % for monthly values. New empirical factors, for use with MORECS grass PE, PENSE and PETCALC, have been calculated from the measured values at Kempton Park. The effect of different climate types in England and Wales on the accuracy of estimates of open water evaporation made using these factors has been investigated. The results show that estimates of annual evaporation based on MORECS grass PE and PENSE should be regarded as having an accuracy of ±15 %, whilst those based on PETCALC have an accuracy of ±25 %. The accuracy in estimates of monthly evaporation have a strong seasonality with an accuracy of ±50 % in the summer months (July to October incl.) and ±200 % during the winter months. The accuracy of corrections for differences in altitude, between the meteorological station and the site for which an estimate of open water evaporation is to be made, have been tested. It has been shown that an accuracy of between ±5 and ±30 % in annual estimates of open water can be achieved using data from a station in the same climate region and correcting the driving variables. However, there is a strong seasonal difference in the accuracy on estimates of monthly open water evaporation. Correcting estimates of evaporation directly results in the error being decreased by between 30 % and 50 % from no altitudinal correction being applied. It is recommended that the Agency should, in the long term, adopt the equilibrium temperature model as its method of estimating open water evaporation. In the meantime, it should make use of the empirical factors developed by this project to be applied to MORECS grass PE, PENSE and PETCALC. Practical guidance in the use of the empirical factors and equilibrium temperature methods by Agency staff has been provided in a handbook vi R&D TECHNICAL REPORT W6-043/TR "Estimating open water evaporation – guidance for Environment Agency practitioners" produced as part of the output from this R&D project. Further research is recommended into determining values for the parameters required by the equilibrium temperature model, appropriate lapse rates for the driving variables and how thermal stratification of water bodies affects evaporation rates.},

abstract = {This first paper of the two-part series describes the objectives of the community efforts in improving the Noah land surface model (LSM), documents, through mathematical formulations, the augmented conceptual realism in biophysical and hydrological processes, and introduces a framework for multiple options to parameterize selected processes (Noah-MP). The Noah-MP's performance is evaluated at various local sites using high temporal frequency data sets, and results show the advantages of using multiple optional schemes to interpret the differences in modeling simulations. The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework.

abstract = {Sedimentary processes were monitored in a varved lake in the Canadian High Arctic through three melt seasons and revealed that seasonal sediment deposition rates were highly dependent on short-lived inflow events driven by high suspended sediment concentrations that varied with runoff intensity. Our results illustrate that in accordance with the suspended sediment discharge into the lake, the rate of sediment accumulation changed over short distances downlake, in a given year. This result indicates that there is a rate and accumulation dependence on short-lived, intense inflow conditions. In addition, there was strong evidence for substantial decoupling between deposition rate and mean grain size of sedimentary deposits. These results have important implications for paleoclimate interpretation of annually laminated sedimentary records from dynamic lake environments and suggest that grain size measures may not be representative proxies of inflow competence. Grain size indices based on a measure of the coarser fraction, rather than the bulk sediment, may be more appropriate to use as a link between contemporary runoff processes and sedimentary characteristics.},

abstract = {Holocene climate, vegetation, and fire history were reconstructed using pollen, molluscs, and charcoal from two lake sediment records (Scum and Norma lakes) collected from the Chilcotin Plateau, British Columbia, Canada. In the late-glacial period, cold steppe prevailed and fire was limited. Artemisia steppe expanded in the earliest Holocene as climate warmed and conditions became dry, with shallow basins drying out. High-frequency surface fires maintained the steppe. An increase in Pinus after 10 200 cal BP signals moistening and the establishment of Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson and Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. stands, with surface fires in the former and higher severity fires in the latter. Cooling around 8500 cal BP favored P. contorta, and a crown fire regime likely prevailed, with intermittent surface fires. Shallow basins began to fill with water. In the mid-Holocene, basins filled further and Picea increased slightly in abundance. Fire frequency decreased, though severity increased. In the last three millennia, modern P. contorta dominated forests were established, with mixed-severity fire disturbance. Considering the future, the results of this study align well with ecosystem climate niche simulations, indicating that non-arboreal and open-forest communities may again prevail widely on the plateau, together with surface fires. Land managers need to develop strategies to manage the upcoming transformation.},

Results from water samples and sediment traps show that the suspended sediment in the lake is mainly distributed by underflows during the time of the largest sediment input from May to mid-August. This leads to the deposition of the basal silt layers of the varves. Settling of fine-grained suspension from interflows dominates sedimentation between August and October, forming the final layer of fine-grained material at the end of the annual deposition cycle. The median grain-size at the top of the varves is always below 5 $\mu$m and thus defines the varve boundaries.

abstract = {This review surveys the basic theories, observational methods, satellite algorithms, and land surface models for terrestrial evapotranspiration, E (or $\lambda$E, i.e., latent heat flux), including a long‐term variability and trends perspective. The basic theories used to estimate E are the Monin‐Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), the Bowen ratio method, and the Penman‐Monteith equation. The latter two theoretical expressions combine MOST with surface energy balance. Estimates of E can differ substantially between these three approaches because of their use of different input data. Surface and satellite‐based measurement systems can provide accurate estimates of diurnal, daily, and annual variability of E. But their estimation of longer time variability is largely not established. A reasonable estimate of E as a global mean can be obtained from a surface water budget method, but its regional distribution is still rather uncertain. Current land surface models provide widely different ratios of the transpiration by vegetation to total E. This source of uncertainty therefore limits the capability of models to provide the sensitivities of E to precipitation deficits and land cover change.

abstract = {Franklin Glacier is an 18-km-long valley glacier that originates in a broad icefield below the west face of Mt. Waddington in the central British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada. Radiocarbon-dated wood samples from the proximal faces of lateral moraines flanking Franklin Glacier show that the glacier expanded at least nine times since 13,000 cal. yr BP. A probable Younger Dryas advance of Franklin Glacier at 12,910–12,690 cal. yr BP followed the late glacial retreat and down wasting of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet from ca. 16,000 to 12,900 cal. yr BP. During the succeeding early Holocene warm period, Franklin Glacier appears to have retreated significantly, leaving no record of glacial expansion until the mid-Holocene when it repeatedly advanced at 6360–6280, 5470–5280 and 4770–4580 cal. yr BP. Down wasting of the glacier surface after ca. 4770–4580 cal. yr BP was followed by intervals of expansion at 4260–4080, 3210–3020 and 2620–2380 cal. yr BP. Following ice expansion at ca. 2620–2380 cal. yr BP into trees over 224 years in age, there is no record of the glacier activity until 1570–1480 cal. yr BP when Franklin Glacier thickened and advanced into young subalpine fir trees. During the ‘Little Ice Age', advances at 800–680, 610–560 and 570–510 cal. yr BP preceded a mid-19th to early 20th century advance that saw Franklin Glacier attain its maximum Holocene extent. The dendroglaciological record at Franklin Glacier is among the most comprehensive recovered from the British Columbia Coast Mountains and showcases the complexity of mid- to late Holocene glacier expansion in the region.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The well-developed moraines of the Little Ice Age represent the most significant regional Holocene glacial event in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The application of dating techniques (documentary sources, dendrochronology, lichenometry and radiocarbon dating) appropriate to this timeframe are briefly reviewed and summary data from 33 glaciers are presented. Three main periods of moraine development are recognised (i) 1500-1700 A.D., represented by small fragments of poorly dated moraines, (ii) early 1700's when about one-third of the glaciers show a maximum advance, (iii) mid-to-late-nineteenth century when major readvances built moraines close to or beyond (i) and (ii). In addition to these periods, 14C dates from overridden trees indicate a 12th/13th century glacial advance to within 400 and 1400 m of the Little Ice Age Maximum positions at Robson and Kiwa (Premier Range) Glaciers respectively. Prior to this advance a period of warmer conditions is inferred between ca. 700-1100 A.D. from the presence of large, 14C-dated snags at tree-line near the Athabasca Glacier, including a 1000 14C yr-old larch (probably Larix lyallii) about 90 km northwest of its present limit. Tree-line may have readvanced at the Athabasca site between ca. 1300-1700 A.D. but receded again during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Future research should be directed towards using the relatively long tree-ring records (500-1000 yrs, with cross-dating) of this area for climatic reconstructions.},

abstract = {[I] The force-restore method (FRh4) was originally developed for estimating diurnal fluctuations in the ground surface temperature. Because of its relatively simple parameterization, it is commonly applied in meteorological and other models for this purpose. Its application to the calcillation of deeper soil temperatures, to frozen soils, and to soils under snow covers has heretofore not been possible. This study demonstrates an extension of the FRh4 that permits accurate estimates of seasonal variation in mean daily deep soil temperature. The extended FRM is shown to provide a lower boundary condition for the heat conduction method, permitting a combination of the two approaches that avoids some limitations of each. The combined approach provides representations of the mean daily soil temperature, soil temperature at depth in frozen soils, and ground surface temperature under a snow cover. Diurnal variations can also be calculated. The extended method and combined approaches are tested using field site measurements collected in cold weather periods in Saskatchewan, Canada, and are found to provide a reasonable representation of measurements. extension of the force-restore method to estimating soil temperature at depth and evaluation for frozen soils under snow,},

abstract = {Forest clearings are common features of evergreen forests and produce snowpack accumulation and melt differing from that in adjacent forests and open terrain. This study has investigated the challenges in specifying the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat to snowpacks in forest clearings. The snowpack in two forest clearings in the Canadian Rockies was simulated using a one-dimensional (1D) snowpack model. A trade-off was found between optimizing against measured snow surface temperature or snowmelt when choosing how to specify the turbulent fluxes. Schemes using the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory tended to produce negatively biased surface temperature, while schemes that enhanced turbulent fluxes, to reduce the surface temperature bias, resulted in too much melt. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo experiments showed that no realistic parameter set could successfully remove biases in both surface temperature and melt. A simple scheme that excludes atmospheric stability correction was required to successfully simulate surface temperature under low wind speed conditions. Nonturbulent advective fluxes and/or nonlocal sources of turbulence are thought to account for the maintenance of heat exchange in low-wind conditions. The simulation of snowmelt was improved by allowing enhanced latent heat fluxes during low-wind conditions. Caution is warranted when snowpack models are optimized on surface temperature, as model tuning may compensate for deficiencies in conceptual and numerical models of radiative, conductive, and turbulent heat exchange at the snow surface and within the snowpack. Such model tuning could have large impacts on the melt rate and timing of the snow-free transition in simulations of forest clearings within hydrological and meteorological models.},

abstract = {Executive Summary Marmot Creek Research Basin was the subject of intense studies of snowmelt, water balance and streamflow generation in order to generate a five year database of precipitation inputs, snowpack dynamics and streamflow that could be used in hydrological model testing. A physically based hydrological model of the basin was constructed using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model and tested over four years of simulation. The model was found to accurately simulate snowpacks in forested and cleared landscapes and the timing and quantity of streamflow over the basin. The model was manipulated to simulate the impacts of forest disturbance on basin snow dynamics, snowmelt, streamflow and groundwater recharge. A total of 40 forest disturbance scenarios were compared to the current land use over the four simulation years. Disturbance scenarios ranged from the impact of pine beetle kill of lodgepole pine to clearing of north or south facing slopes, forest fire and salvage logging impacts. Pine beetle impacts were small in all cases with increases in snowmelt of less than 10% and of streamflow and groundwater recharge of less than 2%. This is due to only 15% of the basin area being covered with lodgepole pine and this pine being at lower elevations which received much lower snowfall and rainfall than did higher elevations and so generated much less streamflow and groundwater recharge. Forest disturbance due to fire and clearing affected much large areas of the basin and higher elevations and were generally more than twice as effective in increasing snowmelt or streamflow. For complete forest cover removal with salvage logging a 45% increase in snowmelt was simulated, however this only translated into a 5% increase in spring and summer streamflow and a 7% increase in groundwater recharge. Forest fire with retention of standing burned trunks was the most effect forest cover treatment for increasing streamflow (up to 8%) due to minimizing both sublimation of winter snow and summer evaporation rates. Peak daily streamflow discharges responded more strongly to forest cover decrease than did seasonal streamflow with increases of over 20% in peak streamflow with removal of forest cover. It is suggested that the dysynchronization of snowmelt timing with forest cover removal resulted in an ineffective translation of changes in snowmelt quantity to streamflow. This resulted in a complementary increase in groundwater recharge as well as streamflow as forest cover was reduced. Presumably, a basin with differing soil characteristics, groundwater regime or topographic orientation would provide a differing hydrological response to forest cover change and the sensitivity of these changes to basin characterisation needs further examination.},

abstract = {Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was measured at 30-min resolution over a 19-month period (September 28, 2000-April 23, 2002) from a nonirrigated pasture site in Florida, USA, using eddy correlation methods. The relative magnitude of measured ETa (about 66% of long-term annual precipitation at the study site) indicates the importance of accurate ET a estimates for water resources planning. The time and cost associated with direct measurements of ETa and the rarity of historical measurements of ETa make the use of methods relying on more easily obtainable data desirable. Several such methods (Penman-Monteith (PM), modified Priestley-Taylor (PT), reference evapotranspiration (ET 0), and pan evaporation (Ep)) were related to measured ETa using regression methods to estimate PM bulk surface conductance, PT $\alpha$, ET0 vegetation coefficient, and Ep pan coefficient. The PT method, where the PT $\alpha$ is a function of green-leaf area index (LAI) and solar radiation, provided the best relation with ET a (standard error (SE) for daily ETa of 0.11 mm). The PM method, in which the bulk surface conductance was a function of net radiation and vapor-pressure deficit, was slightly less effective (SE=0.15 mm) than the PT method. Vegetation coefficients for the ET0 method (SE=0.29 mm) were found to be a simple function of LAI. Pan coefficients for the Ep method (SE=0.40 mm) were found to be a function of LAI and Ep. Historical or future meteorological, LAI, and pan evaporation data from the study site could be used, along with the relations developed within this study, to provide estimates of ETa in the absence of direct measurements of ETa. Additionally, relations among PM, PT, and ET0 methods and ETa can provide estimates of ETa in other, environmentally similar, pasture settings for which meteorological and LAI data can be obtained or estimated. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The central interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada, is dissected by numerous elongate, glacially overdeepened lake basins akin to coastal fiords. An air-gun seismic-reflection investigation (242 km of trackline) of Okanagan Lake (120 km long, ∼3.5 km wide) shows that the Pleistocene sediment fill is up to 792 m thick and that bedrock has been excavated by repeated Pleistocene glacial erosion to nearly 650 m below sea level. The depth of bedrock incision below the surrounding plateau is more than 2000 m, exceeding that of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. The total volume of sediment infill within the narrow trenchlike basin is more than 90 km3, and several lines of evidence suggest that this fill accumulated rapidly during a single phase of glaciolacustrine sedimentation during late Wisconsin deglaciation of the region after 15 ka. Similar fiord-lake basins, up to 100 km long, are common in the interior of British Columbia. If the data from Okanagan are representative, these basins may represent a major previously unrecognized component of the total glacial sediment flux to the ocean. Overdeepening below sea level and the focusing of large volumes of glacial sediment and meltwater into such basins are of considerable glaciologic significance and may record the fast, unstable flow of "ice streams" during deglaciation of the Cordilleran ice sheet.},

abstract = {Rain-on-snow (ROS) is a major contributor to flooding and landslides in many temperate coastal watersheds around the world. Research has shown that forest harvesting can increase melt rates during ROS at both the stand and watershed scale. Because of this, post disturbance hydrological recovery is of interest in watersheds where forest management is prevalent. Recent research that pairs events by frequency rather than chronologically has indicated that forest cover removal can have a significant effect on the magnitude and frequency of extreme events, which is counter to the dominant view in forest hydrology. Hydrological modelling provides a means to apply frequency based analysis in watersheds with short data records, but models must be tested and validated in coastal watersheds before they can be applied extensively. A key challenge to testing models is the inherent difficulty with collecting data in ROS environments. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to design a methodology that recorded previously unobserved processes, use these data to validate model simulations and assess stand level energy flux recovery during ROS. Data were collected at a range of elevations within recently harvested, regenerating and old growth forests. The Cold Regions Hydrological Model generally performed well at capturing the dynamics of snow accumulation and melt, however, snow water equivalent was generally over-predicted. Depths of transient snowpacks were generally under-predicted, however, once a snowpack was established model performance improved. Clear-cut forests had higher mean and greater variability of energy inputs resulting in large events occurring more frequently than in old or second growth forests. Energy flux recovery was evident within the regenerating forests; however, both the rates of recovery and differences among stands depended on the location and the variables compared. When either the mean or standard deviation of energy inputs differed from that of old growth forests, energy flux recovery was reduced as events became larger and less frequent. It is probable that results obtained from this study will translate to stream flow in watersheds with steep slopes, shallow soils and extensive preferential flow networks (i.e. high run-off coefficients), especially when run-off generating areas are synchronized.},

abstract = {Development of a physical model study for the Niagara River discharge into Lake Ontario is described. The model is designed on the basis of (distorted) Froude and Rossby similarity and the results demonstrate clearly the effects of rotation on the flow. Important features of the plume are shown to be reproduced by the model, including its anticyclonic (right-turning) flow and the subsequent formation of a near-shore current along the southern coastline. A scaling analysis of the integrated longitudinal momentum equation is suggested as a framework for analyzing this type of flow. This analysis considers three regions of the flow: (1) a near-field, where inertial forces are balanced by pressure and bottom drag; (2) an intermediate-field where the balance is between inertia and buoyancy; and (3) afar-field characterized by nearly geostrophic flow (balance between buoyancy and rotation). This scheme is then tested against conditions characteristic of the Niagara River discharge during spring flows and also with observations from the physical model tests, showing reasonable agreement. One particular result of interest is that the distance at which rotation starts to turn the flow scales approximately with the internal Rossby radius. Results of the study help to distinguish between the relative effects of buoyancy and rotation.},

abstract = {Heightened awareness of global change issues within both science and political communities has increased interest in using the global network of eddy covariance flux towers to more fully understand the impacts of natural and anthropogenic phenomena on the global carbon balance. Comparisons of net ecosystem exchange (FNEE) responses are being made among biome types, phenology patterns, and stress conditions. The comparisons are usually performed on annual sums of FNEE; however, the average data coverage during a year is only 65%. Therefore, robust and consistent gap filling methods are required. We review several methods of gap filling and apply them to data sets available from the EUROFLUX and AmeriFlux databases. The methods are based on mean diurnal variation (MDV), look-up tables (LookUp), and nonlinear regressions (Regr.), and the impact of different gap filling methods on the annual sum of FNEE is investigated. The difference between annual FNEE filled by MDV compared to FNEE filled by Regr. ranged from -45 to +200 g C m-2 per year (MDV-Regr.). Comparing LookUp and Regr. methods resulted in a difference (LookUp-Regr.) ranging from -30 to +150 g C m-2 per year. We also investigated the impact of replacing measurements at night, when turbulent mixing is insufficient. The nighttime correction for low friction velocities (u*) shifted annual FNEE on average by +77 g C m-2 per year, but in certain cases as much as + 185 g C m-2 per year. Our results emphasize the need to standardize gap filling-methods for improving the comparability of flux data products from regional and global flux networks. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Several major Pacific Northwest floods over the last decade have been attributed in part to the effects of logging. This concern has heightened the need for better scientific understanding of forest canopy effects on snow accumulation and melt. During a three year field investigation in the Umpqua National Forest, OR (elevation 1200 m), weighing lysimeters and cut-tree experiments were used to observe snow interception and its fate while providing continuous observations of below-canopy snowpack evolution. Approximately 60 percent of annual snowfall was intercepted by the canopy (maximum of 40 mm water equivalent). Approximately 72 percent and 28 percent of the intercepted snow was removed as meltwater drip and large snow masses, respectively. Apparent sublimation rates from the intercepted snow were less than 1 mm per day. Snow interception and ancillary observations, including standard micrometeorology, were used to develop and test an energy balance model of snow as affected by the forest canopy. Although initial implemented and tested on the Umpqua data, the model was designed for implementation in spatially distributed hydrology models for application at larger scales. Intercepted snow load was modeled as a function of Leaf Area Index. Removal of intercepted snow by sublimation, melt-water drip and mass release was explicitly modeled. A fractional canopy coverage parameter was used to scale from the plot to the stand scale.},

abstract = {Native Nothofagus forests in the midlatitude region of the Andes Cordillera are notorious biodiversity hot spots, uniquely situated in the Southern Hemisphere such that they develop in snow‐dominated reaches of this mountain range. Spanning a smaller surface area than similar ecosystems, where forests and snow coexist in the Northern Hemisphere, the interaction between vegetation and snow processes in this ecotone has received lesser attention. We present the first systematic study of snow–vegetation interactions in the Nothofagus forests of the Southern Andes, focusing on how the interplay between interception and climate determines patterns of snow water equivalent (SWE) variability. The Valle Hermoso experimental catchment, located in the Nevados de Chill{\'{a}}n vicinity, was fitted with eight snow depth sensors that provided continuous measurements at varying elevations, aspect, and forest cover. Also, manual measurements of snow properties were obtained during snow surveys conducted during end of winter and spring seasons for 3 years, between 2015 and 2017. Each year was characterized by distinct climatological conditions, with 2016 representing one of the driest winters on record in this region. Distance to canopy, leaf area index, and total gap area were measured at each observational site. A regression model was built on the basis of statistical analysis of local parameters to model snow interception in this kind of forest. We find that interception implied a 23.2% reduction in snow accumulation in forested sites compared with clearings. The interception in these deciduous trees represents, on average, 23.6% of total annual snowfall, reaching a maximum measured interception value of 13.8‐mm SWE for all snowfall events analysed in this research.},

abstract = {We recovered sediment cores from Cheakamus Lake in the southern Coast Mountains, southwest British Columbia, to reconstruct late Holocene environmental conditions in the watershed. The cored sediments are inorganic, rhythmically laminated clayey silt. Radiocarbon ages and correlation of lamina thickness with the magnitude of the annual flood recorded at a nearby gauging station indicate that the laminae are varves. We discriminate seven types of varves on the basis of couplet thickness and internal structure, and compare them to annual hydrographs over the period of record. The seven varve types record summer snowmelt floods, autumn floods, mid-season floods, years with two major floods, years with three major floods, years with more than three major floods, and periods of sustained glacier runoff. Varves attributed to autumn storms and glacier runoff are dominant, exhibit serial dependence, and are most common during six periods: AD 1300-1320, 1380-1410, 1470-1500, 1710-1730, 1880-1906, and 1916-1945. In contrast, varves attributed to summer snowmelt floods are randomly distributed through time. Thickest varves occur during the decades AD 1090-1110, 1120-1170, 1210-1250, 1310-1330, 1390-1450, 1720-1780, 1860-1900, and 1920-1945. The relation between Little Ice Age glacier activity and lake sedimentation is complex, but the thickest varves coincide with times of rapid glacier retreat and periods when air temperatures were warmer than average. The results confirm the importance of sediment transfers during the summer and autumn runoff season in the British Columbia Coast Mountains. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Here we present the first high-resolution late-Holocene glacier record from the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. The study is based on analyses of lacustrine sediments from the distal glacier-fed lake Kveitvikvatnet (30.1 m a.s.l.), as well as glacial-geomorphological mapping of the $\sim$4.2-km2 surrounding catchment. The lake sediment cores have been examined for input of glacial-derived sediments by using physical, geochemical and magnetic sediment properties, including x-ray fluorescence (XRF), magnetic susceptibility (MS), grain size analyses, dry bulk density (DBD) and loss-on-ignition (LOI). Former glacier extent has been reconstructed using aerial photography and glacial-geomorphological mapping. Lichenometric dating has been used to construct a moraine chronology covering the recent fluctuations of the largest glacier (back to AD $\sim$1740). AMS radiocarbon dating reveals that the lake sediment record covers the last 1200 years, thereby including both the ‘Little Ice Age' (LIA) and the ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA). By linking continuously deposited lake sediment proxies of glacier fluctuation to known glacier frontal positions and an independent temperature reconstruction, former fluctuations in the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) and winter precipitation have been reconstructed. Reconstructed winter precipitation estimates have also been correlated to instrumental data from the region back to AD 1895 and show a remarkable correlation, which further strengthens our approach. We found that both MCA and LIA were periods of substantial glacier variations with respect to the present, with a maximum lowering of the ELA of $\sim$75 and $\sim$85 m, respectively. Increased precipitation during these intervals, associated with more frequent and/or intense winter storms, is suggested to be the major driving force of glacier fluctuations in Lofoten.},

abstract = {This paper presents examples of environmental changes in the Canadian Rockies in the context of a 1.5°C increase in mean annual temperatures over the last 100 years. During this period increases in winter temperatures have been more than twice as large as those during spring and summer. Glacier cover has decreased by at least 25% during the 20th century and glacier fronts have receded to positions last occupied ca. 3000 years ago. These two lines of evidence suggest that the climate of the late 20th century is exceptional in the context of the last 1000 to 3000 years. Detailed studies in three closely located upper treeline sites document variable responses of vegetation to climate change that reflect species differences as well as local differences in microclimate and site conditions. Treeline has advanced upslope in response to climate warming, but site and species differences control the rate and nature of the advance. Human impacts on the environment compound the changes due to climate warming. Historic photographs indicate significant changes in the type and density of forest cover due to the absence of significant forest fires within these National Parks during the last 70-80 years. The visual impact of these changes, which partially reflects a policy of fire suppression, is far greater than the impact of changes associated with more direct tourist-related impacts. It is therefore important that monitoring programs examine vegetation changes over the entire landscape rather than focussing exclusively on supposedly climate-sensitive sites.},

Redistribution of intercepted snow between storms occurred once out of the 21 possible times. It accounted for 2% of the measured accumulation in the clearing. Regression of the percent difference in SWE between the upwind forest and the clearing versus windspeed showed a negative correlation (r = -0.74).

The highest rates of glacier advance (c. 3.8 m yr-1 ) occurred between AD 1214 and 1261 based on a series of kill dates from in-situ stumps. Between c. AD 1142-1214 and 1261-1350 rates were somewhat lower at c. 2-2.5 m yr-1. This glacier advance terminated upvalley of the 'Little Ice Age' maximum position of Robson Glacier and there is no evidence at this site for glacial events between AD 1350 and 1783. However, two smaller glaciers in the Robson area and the main tongue of Small River Glacier have outermost 'Little Ice Age' moraines that date from the first decades of the AD 1700s.

Consequently, climate-mediated changes to coastal terrestrial ecosystems and hydrologic regimes have high potential to influence nearshore ocean chemistry and food web dynamics. Research from tightly coupled, high-flux coastal ecosystems can advance understanding of terrestrial–marine links and climate sensitivities more generally. In the present article, we use the northeast Pacific coastal temperate rainforest as a model system to evaluate such links. We focus on key above- and belowground production and hydrological transport processes that control the land-to-ocean flow of materials and their influence on nearshore marine ecosystems. We evaluate how these connections may be altered by global climate change and we identify knowledge gaps in our understanding of the source, transport, and fate of terrestrial materials along this coastal margin. Finally, we propose five priority research themes in this region that are relevant for understanding coastal ecosystem links more broadly.},

abstract = {Calibration is an essential step for improving the accuracy of simulations generated using hydrologic models. A key modeling decision is selecting the performance metric to be optimized. It has been common to use squared error performance metrics, or normalized variants such as Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), based on the idea that their squared-error nature will emphasize the estimates of high flows. However, we conclude that NSE-based model calibrations actually result in poor reproduction of high-flow events, such as the annual peak flows that are used for flood frequency estimation. Using three different types of performance metrics, we calibrate two hydrological models at a daily step, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM), and evaluate their ability to simulate high-flow events for 492 basins throughout the contiguous United States. The metrics investigated are (1) NSE, (2) Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and its variants, and (3) annual peak flow bias (APFB), where the latter is an application-specific metric that focuses on annual peak flows. As expected, the APFB metric produces the best annual peak flow estimates; however, performance on other high-flow-related metrics is poor. In contrast, the use of NSE results in annual peak flow estimates that are more than 20% worse, primarily due to the tendency of NSE to underestimate observed flow variability. On the other hand, the use of KGE results in annual peak flow estimates that are better than from NSE, owing to improved flow time series metrics (mean and variance), with only a slight degradation in performance with respect to other related metrics, particularly when a non-standard weighting of the components of KGE is used. Stochastically generated ensemble simulations based on model residuals show the ability to improve the high-flow metrics, regardless of the deterministic performances. However, we emphasize that improving the fidelity of streamflow dynamics from deterministically calibrated models is still important, as it may improve high-flow metrics (for the right reasons). Overall, this work highlights the need for a deeper understanding of performance metric behavior and design in relation to the desired goals of model calibration.},

The evaluation is based on comparisons with experimental measurements of AΕT applying the ‘Bowen ratio' method. Hourly experimental data, of air temperature, humidity, wind speed and radiation balance measurements, taken at a 0.5 ha olive orchard in the rural area of Sparta (37° 04΄ N, 22°05΄ E), during the period from June 2010 up to July 2014, are used. The rc estimated by KP model is parameterized by a semi-empirical approach which requires a simple calibration procedure, while rc from TD model is parameterized using a theoretical approach. For estimating AET from minimum data (air temperature, humidity and radiation balance components) the PT model is also employed, since rc is not required and the aerodynamic term of PM is taken into account in the empirical parameter of the model. The results show that PT and KP models are the most appropriate [Refined Index of Agreement (RIA) equal to 0.89 or 0.88, respectively] followed by the TD model (RIA = 0.78). PT or KP models underestimate AET by 9.3% or 9.8%, respectively, while TD model overestimates AET by 15.0%, increased up to 25.8%, during warm period.},

Predicted velocities are calculated using the center-of-mass model of avalanche motion; frequencies are estimated using dendrochronological techniques. Results show velocities and average interval between avalanches to be positively correlated. Average slope angle of the entire avalanche path is a good indicator of both velocities and average interval. Paths with steeper average slope angle have longer average intervals between avalanches and larger expected velocities in the 10 degree slope runout position. Effects of avalanche frequency and velocities on changing vegetation cover from shrubs to trees is suggested to be due to differences in plant growth rates and life span. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {The snow surface temperature (SST) is essential for estimating longwave radiation fluxes from snow. SST can be diagnosed using finescale multilayer snow physics models that track changes in snow properties and internal energy; however, these models are heavily parameterized, have high predictive uncertainty, and require continuous simulation to estimate prognostic state variables. Here, a relatively simple model to estimate SST that is not reliant on prognostic state variables is proposed. The model assumes that the snow surface is poorly connected thermally to the underlying snowpack and largely transparent for most of the shortwave radiation spectrum, such that a snow surface energy balance among only sensible heat, latent heat, longwave radiation, and near-infrared radiation is possible and is called the radiative psychrometric model (RPM). The RPM SST is sensitive to air temperature, humidity, ventilation, and longwave irradiance and is secondarily affected by absorption of near-infrared radiation at the snow surface that was higher where atmospheric deposition of particulates was more likely to be higher. The model was implemented with neutral stability, an implicit windless exchange coefficient, and constant shortwave absorption factors and aerodynamic roughness lengths. It was evaluated against radiative SST measurements from the Canadian Prairies and Rocky Mountains, French Alps, and Bolivian Andes. With optimized and global shortwave absorption and aerodynamic roughness length parameters, the model is shown to accurately predict SST under a wide range of conditions, providing superior predictions when compared to air temperature, dewpoint, or ice bulb calculation approaches.},

Terrestrial photography offers a high potential to monitor snow cover variability, but its application is often limited to small catchment scales. Here, we present a semiautomatic procedure to derive snow cover maps from publicly available webcam images in the Swiss Alps and propose a procedure for the georectification and snow classification of such images. In order to avoid the effort of manually setting ground control points (GCPs) for each webcam, we implement a novel registration approach that automatically resolves camera parameters (camera orientation; principal point; field of view, FOV) by using an estimate of the webcams' positions and a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Furthermore, we propose an automatic image-to-image alignment to correct small changes in camera orientation and compare and analyze two recent snow classification methods. The resulting snow cover maps indicate whether a DEM grid is snow-covered, snow-free, or not visible from webcams' positions. GCPs are used to evaluate our novel automatic image registration approach. The evaluation reveals a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.1&thinsp;m for standard lens webcams (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">FOV<48</span><span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ&circ;</span>) and a RMSE of 36.3&thinsp;m for wide-angle lens webcams (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">FOV≥48</span><span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ&circ;</span>).

The return of glacial meltwater transport to Lake L{\"{o}}gurinn, and thus a return of Eyjabakkaj{\"{o}}kull is dated to ca 4400 years BP, suggesting an almost 5000 years long glacier-free period during early and mid-Holocene. During this time period, we infer that the 8.2 ka cold event did not cause a significant expansion of Eyjabakkaj{\"{o}}kull, however, we note a marked decrease in the aquatic productivity in Lake L{\"{o}}gurinn, which is suggested to be the result of shorter ice-free seasons of Lake L{\"{o}}gurinn. The Holocene Thermal Maximum is inferred by a period of maximum Holocene aquatic productivity, and dated to ca 7900-7000 years BP. Following the re-formation of Eyjabakkaj{\"{o}}kull ca 4400 years BP, we suggest that the glacier reached stable conditions ca 1700 years BP, and remained fairly stable until the later part of the Little Ice Age, when Eyjabakkaj{\"{o}}kull reached its maximum Holocene extent. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study combines a process-based snow model (SnowModel) with eddy covariance (EC) measurements to investigate (1) the spatio-temporal variability of simulated snow sublimation with respect to station observations, (2) the contribution of snow sublimation to the ablation of the snowpack, and (3) the sensitivity and response of snow sublimation to bark beetle-induced forest mortality and climate warming across the north-central Colorado Rocky Mountains. EC-based observations of snow sublimation compared well with simulated snow sublimation at stations dominated by surface and canopy sublimation, but blowing snow sublimation in alpine areas was not well captured by the EC instrumentation. Water balance calculations provided an important validation of simulated sublimation at the watershed scale. Simulated snow sublimation across the study area was equivalent to 28% of winter precipitation on average, and the highest relative snow sublimation fluxes occurred during the lowest snow years. Snow sublimation from forested areas accounted for the majority of sublimation fluxes, highlighting the importance of canopy and sub-canopy surface sublimation in this region. Simulations incorporating the effects of tree mortality due to bark-beetle disturbance resulted in a 4% reduction in snow sublimation from forested areas. Snow sublimation rates corresponding to climate warming simulations remained unchanged or slightly increased, but total sublimation losses decreased by up to 6% because of a reduction in snow covered area and duration.},

abstract = {Episodic growth and decay of the Cordilleran ice sheet during the Pleistocene has imposed order on Quaternary stratigraphies in British Columbia and southern Yukon Territory. Although Quaternary deposits in this region are inherently complex, thick valley and lowland fills consist of discrete packages of glacial sediments separated by unconformities or by generally thin, patchy interglacial deposits. Some unconformities define former valley and lowland landscapes of similar relief to the present. Each package of glacial sediments displays stratigraphic order: distinctive fluvial and lacustrine units, deposited during the early stage of a glaciation and later overridden and eroded by glaciers, are overlain by retreat phase and interglacial fluvial, lacustrine, and marine sediments. Packages of glacial sediments contain one or more unconformities produced by glacial erosion; commonly the unconformities are better stratigraphic markers than tills, which are not always present, especially in valleys. The Quaternary stratigraphic record in the Canadian Cordillera becomes less complete with age, owing to repeated erosion during both interglaciations and glaciations. The most complete glacial sequence is the youngest, deposited during the late Wisconsin Fraser Glaciation. Deposits of the penultimate glaciation are common but generally incomplete. Only sporadic remnants of older, apparently Middle and Early Pleistocene glacial deposits are present in the Cordillera.},

abstract = {Acoustic and sedimentary properties of three fiord systems were examined in the region of Disko Bugt, West Greenland to understand variability in the processes, rates and sources of sediment delivery during the late glacial and Holocene. Kangerluk and Kangersooq of western Disko are dominated by meltwater inputs of sediment from local ice fields of the island interior. Modern sediments are delivered primarily via overflow currents (rainout), occasional bottom currents and small amounts of iceberg rafting where exposure to Baffin Bay allows penetration of the West Greenland Current.14C and acoustic-derived accumulation rates for the last 1-2 ka vary from about 1 mm a-1in distal fiord settings to more than 5 mm a-1in proximal sites adjacent to actively building deltas. These rates are generally larger than has been observed in other Greenland and Baffin Bay fiords. The tidewater terminus of Inland Ice at Ikerasak is also meltwater dominated but produces lower than expected sediment accumulation due to low gradients of the outlet ice and resistant substrates. These high latitude West Greenland fiords are subarctic in character and contrast significantly with colder polar-type fiords at similar latitudes in East Greenland. Sediment deposition which was focused in the outer Disko fiords during the late-glacial and early Holocene, is due to one of two possible mechanisms: standstill of local ice or enhanced rafting of sediment from Disko Bugt icebergs. This study contributes to the debate on the extent of glaciation and Holocene spatial variability in fiord processes of West Greenland. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Sharp-crested moraines, up to 120 m high and 9 km beyond Little Ice Age glacier limits, record a late Pleistocene advance of alpine glaciers in the Finlay River area in northern British Columbia. The moraines are regional in extent and record climatic deterioration near the end of the last glaciation. Several lateral moraines are crosscut by meltwater channels that record downwasting of trunk valley ice of the northern Cordilleran ice sheet. Other lateral moraines merge with ice-stagnation deposits in trunk valleys. These relationships confirm the interaction of advancing alpine glaciers with the regionally decaying Cordilleran ice sheet and verify a late-glacial age for the moraines. Sediment cores were collected from eight lakes dammed by the moraines. Two tephras occur in basal sediments of five lakes, demonstrating that the moraines are the same age. Plant macrofossils from sediment cores provide a minimum limiting age of 10,550-10,250 cal yr BP (9230 ± 50 14C yr BP) for abandonment of the moraines. The advance that left the moraines may date to the Younger Dryas period. The Finlay moraines demonstrate that the timing and style of regional deglaciation was important in determining the magnitude of late-glacial glacier advances. {\textcopyright} 2008 University of Washington.},

abstract = {Sublimation fluxes during blowing snow have been estimated to return 10-50% of seasonal snowfall to the atmosphere in North American prairie and arctic environments. These fluxes are calculated as part of blowing snow two-phase particle transport models with provision for phase change based upon a particle-scale energy balance. Blowing snow models have normally been evaluated based upon their ability to reproduce diagnostic mass flux gradient measurements and regional-scale snow redistribution patterns and snow mass. Direct evidence is presented here that large latent heat fluxes (40-60 W m-2) that result in sublimation rates of 0.05-0.075 mm snow water equivalent hour-1, are associated with mid-winter, high-latitude blowing snow events. For events with wind speeds above the threshold level for snow transport, these fluxes are in the range of those predicted by the Prairie Blowing Snow Model. The fluxes are well in excess of those found during spring snowmelt and which can be predicted by standard bulk aerodynamic transfer equations, suggesting that blowing snow physics will have to be incorporated in land surface schemes and hydrological models in order to properly represent snow surface mass and energy exchange during blowing snow events.},

abstract = {The continental divide along the spine of the Canadian Rockies in southwestern Canada is a critical headwater region for hydrological drainages to the Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic oceans. Major flooding events are typically attributed to heavy precipitation on its eastern side due to upslope (easterly) flows. Precipitation can also occur on the western side of the divide when moisture originating from the Pacific Ocean encounters the west-facing slopes of the Canadian Rockies. Often, storms propagating across the divide result in significant precipitation on both sides. Meteorological data over this critical region are sparse, with few stations located at high elevations. Given the importance of all these types of events, the Storms and Precipitation Across the continental Divide Experiment (SPADE) was initiated to enhance our knowledge of the atmospheric processes leading to storms and precipitation on either side of the continental divide. This was accomplished by installing specialized meteorological instrumentation on both sides of the continental divide and carrying out manual observations during an intensive field campaign from 24 April-26 June 2019. On the eastern side, there were two field sites: (i) at Fortress Mountain Powerline (2076 m a.s.l.) and (ii) at Fortress Junction Service, located in a high-elevation valley (1580 m a.s.l.). On the western side, Nipika Mountain Resort, also located in a valley (1087 m a.s.l.), was chosen as a field site. Various meteorological instruments were deployed including two Doppler light detection and ranging instruments (lidars), three vertically pointing micro rain radars, and three optical disdrometers. The three main sites were nearly identically instrumented, and observers were on site at Fortress Mountain Powerline and Nipika Mountain Resort during precipitation events to take manual observations of precipitation type and microphotographs of solid particles. The objective of the field campaign was to gather high-Temporal-frequency meteorological data and to compare the different conditions on either side of the divide to study the precipitation processes that can lead to catastrophic flooding in the region. Details on field sites, instrumentation used, and collection methods are discussed. Data from the study are publicly accessible from the Federated Research Data Repository at .},

abstract = {When formulating a hydrologic model, scientists rely on parameterizations of multiple processes based on field data, but literature review suggests that more frequently people select parameterizations that were included in pre-existing models rather than re-evaluating the underlying field experiments. Problems arise when limited field data exist, when “trusted” approaches do not get reevaluated, and when sensitivities fundamentally change in different environments. The physics and dynamics of snow interception by conifers is just such a case, and it is critical to simulation of the water budget and surface albedo. The most commonly used interception parameterization is based on data from four trees from one site, but results from this field study are not directly transferable to locations with relatively warmer winters, where the dominant processes differ dramatically. Here, we combine a literature review with model experiments to demonstrate needed improvements. Our results show that the choice of model form and parameters can vary the fraction of snow lost through interception by as much as 30%. In most simulations, the warming of mean winter temperatures from −7 to 0°C reduces the modelled fraction of snow under the canopy compared to the open, but the magnitude of simulated decrease varies from about 10% to 40%. The range of results is even larger when considering models that neglect the melting of in-canopy snow in higher-humidity environments where canopy sublimation plays less of a role. Thus, we recommend that all models represent canopy snowmelt and include representation of increased loading due to increased adhesion and cohesion when temperatures rise from −3 to 0°C. In addition to model improvements, field experiments across climates and forest types are needed to investigate how to best model the combination of dynamically changing forest cover and snow cover to better understand and predict changes to albedo and water supplies.},

abstract = {Forested areas exhibit high spatial variability in the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE). Previous work has focused on forested areas with respect to snow accumulation in adjacent clearings. There is generally less snow in forested areas with greater variability relative to open areas due to the influence of tree canopies. However, the length scale of the transition from open areas to forested conditions is uncertain. Hence, the goal of this paper is to determine the length scales associated with forest boundary effects on SWE accumulation distribution patterns within forest stands. To accomplish this, we utilize a unique ground-penetrating radar data set collected during the NASA SnowEx campaign on Grand Mesa, Colorado, in February 2017 to determine spatial SWE distribution patterns of areas under canopy and in clearings, and the length scales of transitions between these patterns (i.e., the size of within-stand boundary areas). We define within-stand boundary areas as the transitional zone from a clearing to relatively stable SWE distribution, or background distribution patterns, within forest stands. The largest within-stand boundary effect occurred on the leeward side of stands with a mean extent of 44 m, or 4.3 mean canopy heights. In contrast, windward within-stand boundary effects showed a mean extent of 28 m, or 3.7 mean canopy heights. We present a conceptual framework of the complex wind dynamics that occur in forest stands to explain the within-stand boundary effects on SWE distribution. Future investigations could improve understanding of this complex process and associated driving variables.},

Disaster research and management recognize and emphasize the need to reduce vulnerabilities, although extant policy is not in line with this realization. This paper assesses the extent to which vulnerability to food shortage, as a result of social, demographic, and resource conditions at times of climatic challenge, correlates with subsequent declines in social and food security. Extreme climate challenges are identified in the prehispanic US Southwest and historic Norse occupations of the North Atlantic Islands. Cases with such different environmental, climatic, demographic, and cultural and social traditions allow us to demonstrate a consistent relationship between vulnerability and consequent social and food security conditions, applicable in multiple contexts. This paper identifies rare climate challenges in the long-term history of seven areas, three in the subpolar North Atlantic Islands and four in the arid-to-semiarid deserts of the US Southwest. For each case, the vulnerability to food shortage before the climate challenge is quantified based on eight variables encompassing both environmental and social domains. These data are used to evaluate the relationship between the “weight” of vulnerability before a climate challenge and the nature of social change and food security following a challenge. The outcome of this work is directly applicable to debates about disaster management policy.},

abstract = {Snow sublimation can be an important component of the snow‐cover mass balance, and there is considerable interest in quantifying the role of this process within the water and energy balance of snow‐covered regions. In recent years, robust eddy covariance (EC) instrumentation has been used to quantify snow sublimation over snow‐covered surfaces in complex mountainous terrain. However, EC can be challenging for monitoring turbulent fluxes in snow‐covered environments because of intensive data, power, and fetch requirements, and alternative methods of estimating snow sublimation are often relied upon. To evaluate the relative merits of methods for quantifying surface sublimation, fluxes calculated by the EC, Bowen ratio–energy balance (BR), bulk aerodynamic flux (BF), and aerodynamic profile (AP) methods and their associated uncertainty were compared at two forested openings in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Biases between methods are evaluated over a range of environmental conditions, and limitations of each method are discussed. Mean surface sublimation rates from both sites ranged from 0.33 to 0.36 mm day−1, 0.14 to 0.37 mm day−1, 0.10 to 0.17 mm day−1, and 0.03 to 0.10 mm day−1 for the EC, BR, BF and AP methods, respectively. The EC and/or BF methods are concluded to be superior for estimating surface sublimation in snow‐covered forested openings.

abstract = {We present a computationally simple, theoretically based parameterization for the broadband albedo of snow and ice that can accurately reproduce the theoretical broadband albedo under a wide range of snow, ice, and atmospheric conditions. Depending on its application, this parameterization requires between one and five input parameters. These parameters are specific surface area of snow/ice, concentration of light-absorbing carbon, solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness, and snow depth. The parameterization is derived by fitting equations to albedo estimates generated with a 16-stream plane-parallel, discrete ordinates radiative transfer model of snow and ice that is coupled to a similar model of the atmosphere. Output from this model is also used to establish the physical determinants of the spectral albedo of snow and ice and evaluate the characteristics of spectral irradiance over snow-covered surfaces. Broadband albedo estimates determined from the radiative transfer model are compared with results from a selection of previously proposed parameterizations. Compared to these parameterizations, the newly proposed parameterization produces accurate results for a much wider range of snow, ice, and atmospheric conditions.

abstract = {Within mountainous regions, estimating the exchange of sensible heat and water vapor between the surface and the atmosphere is an important but inexact endeavor. Measurements of the turbulence characteristics of the near-surface boundary layer in complex mountain terrain are relatively scarce, leading to considerable uncertainty in the application of flux-gradient techniques for estimating the surface turbulent heat and mass fluxes. An investigation of the near-surface boundary layer within a 7-ha snow-covered forest clearing was conducted in the Kananaskis River valley, located within the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The homogeneous measurement site was characterized as being relatively calm and sheltered; the wind exhibited considerable unsteadiness, however. Frequent wind gusts were observed to transport turbulent energy into the clearing, affecting the rate of energy transfer at the snow surface. The resulting boundary layer within the clearing exhibited perturbations introduced by the surrounding topography and land surface discontinuities. The measured momentum flux did not scale with the local aerodynamic roughness and mean wind speed profile, but rather was reflective of the larger-scale topographical disturbances. The intermittent nature of the fluxgenerating processes was evident in the turbulence spectra and cospectra where the peak energy was shifted to lower frequencies as compared with those observed in more homogeneous flat terrain. The contribution of intermittent events was studied using quadrant analysis, which revealed that 50% of the sensible and latent heat fluxes was contributed from motions that occupied less than 6% of the time. These results highlight the need for caution while estimating the turbulent heat and mass fluxes in mountain regions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Predicting the rate of snowmelt and intercepted snow sublimation in boreal forests requires an understanding of the effects of snow-covered conifers on the exchange of radiant energy. This study examined the amount of intercepted snow on a jack pine canopy in the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan and the shortwave and net radiation exchange with this canopy, to determine the effect of intercepted snow and canopy structure on shortwave radiation reflection and extinction and net radiation attenuation in a boreal forest. The study focused on clear sky conditions, which are common during winter in the continental boreal forest. Intercepted snow was found to have no influence on the clear-sky albedo of the canopy, the extinction of short wave radiation by the canopy or ratio of net radiation at the canopy top to that at the surface snow cover. Because of the low albedo of the snow-covered canopy, net radiation at the canopy top remains positive and a large potential source of energy for sublimation. The canopy albedo declines somewhat as the extinction efficiency of the underlying canopy increases. The extinction efficiency of short wave radiation in the canopy depends on solar angle because of the approximately horizontal orientation of pine branches. For low solar angles above the horizon, the extinction efficiency is quite low and short wave transmissivity through the canopy is relatively high. As the solar angle increases, extinction increases up to angles of about 50°, and then declines. Extinction of short wave radiation in the canopy strongly influences the attenuation of net radiation by the canopy. Short wave radiation that is extinguished by branches is radiated as long wave, partly downwards to the snow cover. The ratio of net radiation at the canopy top to that at the snow cover surface increases with the extinction of short wave radiation and is negative for low extinction efficiencies. For the pine canopy examined, the daily mean net radiation at the snow cover surface became positive when daily mean solar angles exceeded 22° in late March. Hence, canopy structure and solar angle control the net radiation at the snow cover surface during clear sky conditions and will govern the timing and rate of snowmelt. Models of intercepted snow sublimation and forest snowmelt could beneficially incorporate the canopy radiation balance, which can be extrapolated to stands of various canopy densities, coverage and heights in a physically based manner. Such models could hence avoid 'empirical' temperature index measures that cannot be extrapolated with confidence.},

abstract = {Snow surface temperature is a key control on and result of dynamically coupled energy exchanges at the snow surface. The snow surface temperature is the result of the balance between external forcing (incoming radiation) and energy exchanges above the surface that depend on surface temperature (outgoing longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes) and the transport of energy into the snow by conduction and meltwater influx. Because of the strong insulating properties of snow, thermal gradients in snow packs are large and nonlinear, a fact that has led many to advocate multiple layer snowmelt models over single layer models. In an effort to keep snowmelt modeling simple and parsimonious, the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model used only one layer but allowed the snow surface temperature to be different from the snow average temperature by using an equilibrium gradient parameterization based on the surface energy balance. Although this procedure was considered an improvement over the ordinary single layer snowmelt models, it still resulted in discrepancies between modeled and measured snowpack energy contents. In this paper we evaluate the equilibrium gradient approach, the force-restore approach, and a modified force-restore approach when they are integrated as part of a complete energy and mass balance snowmelt model. The force-restore and modified force-restore approaches have not been incorporated into the UEB in early versions, even though Luce and Tartoton have done work in calculating the energy components using these approaches. In addition, we evaluate a scheme for representing the penetration of a refreezing front in cold periods following melt. We introduce a method to adjust effective conductivity to account for the presence of ground near to a shallow snow surface. These parameterizations were tested against data from the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, CA, Utah State University experimental farm, UT, and subnivean snow laboratory at Niwot Ridge, CO. These tests compare modeled and measured snow surface temperature, snow energy content, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt outflow. We found that with these refinements the model is able to better represent the snowpack energy balance and internal energy content while still retaining a parsimonious one layer format.},

abstract = {Hydrological processes are widely understood to be sensitive to changes in climate, but the effects of concomitant changes in vegetation and soils have seldom been considered in snow-dominated mountain basins. The response of mountain hydrology to vegetation/soil changes in the present and a future climate was modeled in three snowmelt-dominated mountain basins in the North American Cordillera. The models developed for each basin using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modeling platform employed current and expected changes to vegetation and soil parameters and were driven with recent and perturbed high-altitude meteorological observations. Monthly perturbations were calculated using the differences in outputs between the present-and a future-climate scenario from 11 regional climate models. In the three basins, future climate change alone decreased the modeled peak snow water equivalent (SWE) by 11&thinsp;%-47&thinsp;% and increased the modeled evapotranspiration by 14&thinsp;%-20&thinsp;%. However, including future changes in vegetation and soil for each basin changed or reversed these climate change outcomes. In Wolf Creek in the Yukon Territory, Canada, a statistically insignificant increase in SWE due to vegetation increase in the alpine zone was found to offset the statistically significant decrease in SWE due to climate change. In Marmot Creek in the Canadian Rockies, the increase in annual runoff due to the combined effect of soil and climate change was statistically significant, whereas their individual effects were not. In the relatively warmer Reynolds Mountain in Idaho, USA, vegetation change alone decreased the annual runoff volume by 8&thinsp;%, but changes in soil, climate, or both did not affect runoff. At high elevations in Wolf and Marmot creeks, the model results indicated that vegetation/soil changes moderated the impact of climate change on peak SWE, the timing of peak SWE, evapotranspiration, and the annual runoff volume. However, at medium elevations, these changes intensified the impact of climate change, further decreasing peak SWE and sublimation. The hydrological impacts of changes in climate, vegetation, and soil in mountain environments were similar in magnitude but not consistent in direction for all biomes; in some combinations, this resulted in enhanced impacts at lower elevations and latitudes and moderated impacts at higher elevations and latitudes.},

An analytical solution for vertical water flow through homogeneous snow is developed and formulae that allow the solution to accommodate time-varying surface input from rain or snowmelt are derived. This facilitates use of the technique in a computer snowmelt model. Because the new technique requires no matrix computation, it is sufficiently computationally efficient to be a candidate for use in watershed-scale, distributed forecasting systems. Because it is a physically based model that takes into account the effect of the snow itself on the timing and magnitude of outflow, the model allows more accurate prediction of the magnitude and timing of snowmelt than in currently employed operational models. Results of the new model agree well with previous theoretical solutions and with field measurements of melt and rain-on-snow events in a seasonal snow pack. {\textcopyright}1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

These weekly visible-wavelength satellite maps of Northern Hemisphere snow extent produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration constitute the longest consistently-derived satellite record of any environmental variable. We document the considerable intra-annual variability of snow extent, and show that during each month, fluctuations over relatively small areas are responsible for the majority of the year-to-year variability. Regions that cover less than 6% of Northern Hemisphere lands north of 20°N explain 62%–92% of the interannual variance across the continents. On average, snow was more extensive across both Eurasia and North America from the 1970s to middle 1980s than during the late 1980s to late 1990s. During late winter, spring and summer, snow extent has decreased since the middle 1980s, while during fall to middle winter, snow extent has remained relatively constant. Accurate information on continental snow extent is critical for weather and hydrologic forecasting; for understanding hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation, thermal variations, and regional snow extent; and for using snow as a credible indicator of climate variability and change. {\textcopyright} 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {The logistical demands of coring lake sediments tend to preclude the replicate coring necessary to establish error estimates for measured sedimentary parameters. However, if such parameters are to be used to reconstruct sediment yield, and particularly to identify temporal variability of sediment yield, reasonable error estimates are required. In this paper data from a series of alpine lakes in British Columbia are applied to develop a new method for deriving such estimates. Regression surfaces fitted to point values of sediment mass are used to model the physically controlled spatial variability of sedimentation. Deviations from these surfaces are assumed to represent remaining unstructured variance, which constitutes a conservative error estimate. Application of the technique to the alpine lake dataset gives sediment yield estimates with error ranges of ± 7-21 per cent. The potential error is minimized where the spatial variability of sedimentation is strongly predictable. The best fits were achieved for elongate lakes of simple basin morphology. The range of the error estimates is sufficiently low to allow detection of variability in Holocene sediment yield to one of the lakes. By using this technique, absolute sediment yields with associated error estimates may be derived. The associated gains in precision justify multicore approaches to lake sediment-based reconstructions of sediment yield. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

In the present work, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to train a feed-forward multi-layer ANN for the simulation of hydraulic head change at an observation well in the region of Agia, Chania, Greece. Three variants of the PSO algorithm were considered, the classic one with inertia weight improvement, PSO with time varying acceleration coefficients (PSO-TVAC) and global best PSO (GLBest-PSO). The best performance was achieved by GLBest-PSO when implemented using field data from the region of interest, providing improved training results compared to the back-propagation training algorithm. The trained ANN was subsequently used for mid-term prediction of the hydraulic head, as well as for the study of three climate change scenarios. Data time series were created using a stochastic weather generator, and the scenarios were examined for the period 2010-2020. {\textcopyright} 2014 IAHS Press.},

abstract = {Sediments deposited in Moose Lake, British Columbia exhibit three abrupt transitions during the Holocene. Basal diamicts are unconformably overlain by coarse sand and silt deposited as turbidity currents in an ice-dammed lake during final retreat of Wisconsinan ice. Rapid withdrawal of the valley glacier resulted in a fully developed Moose Lake followed by low rates of sediment input for much of the early and middle Holocene until approximately 4,100 years BP. At that time, sediment input doubled and then tripled by 3,120 years BP in response to cooling and several phases of regionally documented glacier expansions. The transition from the Altithermal dry/warm period to the Neoglacial cooling is coincident with the formation of varves at Moose Lake which provide a chronology of changing Neoglacial sediment inputs. The glacier-climate signal recorded in Moose Lake sediments suggests distinct thresholds for changes in sedimentation style that are dependent on both climatic and geomorphic conditions affecting the watershed. Early in the record, direct connection to glaciogenic sediment production produced highly variable sedimentation rates that ended abruptly as the ice-front retreated. In the middle record, climate conditions that led to greatly reduced ice extent and lower sediment production in the upper Fraser and Moose river watersheds, changed abruptly resulting in varve formation. The change in style and increased sedimentation was caused directly by greater seasonal variations in sediment input due to climate-controlled glacier advances beyond modern limits. While sediment supply is a factor, comparison of the sediment record with tree-ring responses to climate change suggest both summer temperature and winter precipitation are important controls of Holocene variations in sediment yield.

abstract = {Snow models that solve coupled energy and mass balances require model parameters to be set, just like their conceptual counterparts. Despite the physical basis of these models, appropriate choices of the parameter values entail a rather high degree of uncertainty as some of them are not directly measurable, observations are lacking, or values are not adaptable from literature. In this study, we test whether it is possible to reach the same performance with energy balance snow models of varying complexity by means of parameter optimization. We utilize a multi-physics snow model which enables the exploration of a multitude of model structures and model complexities with respect to their performance against point-scale observations of snow water equivalent and snowpack runoff observations, and catchment-scale observations of snow cover fraction and spring water balance. We find that parameter uncertainty can compensate structural model deficiencies to a large degree, so that model structures cannot be reliably differentiated within a calibration period. Even with deliberately biased forcing data, comparable calibration performances can be achieved. Our results also show that parameter values need to be chosen very carefully, as no model structure guarantees acceptable simulation results with random (but still physically meaningful) parameters.},

abstract = {Although the record of Holocene glacier fluctuations in British Columbia and Alberta is still very fragmentary, much recent progress has been made in their study. Dating of end moraines has been supplemented by studies of lateral moraine stratigraphy and dating of glacially-overridden organic matter upstream of end moraines. Dates from sites close to contemporary glaciers indicate that ice had retreated to about its present limits before 10 ka BP. Prior to deposition of Mazama tephra, a minor pre-Hypsithermal readvance (the 'Crowfoot Advance') left deposits in the Rockies and the interior of British Columbia. The earliest known Neoglacial advances occurred 5-6 ka BP in the Coast Mountains and shortly after 4 ka BP in the Rockies. An advance culminating ca. 4-3 ka BP has been reported from Bugaboo Glacier, while evidence of another advance culminating in the period ca. 2.5-1.8 ka BP (the 'Tiedemann Advance') is reported from more than one site. Following a recession, the Little Ice Age expansion (the 'Cavell Advance') began shortly after 900 BP. This advance culminated in most cases in the 18th or 19th centuries. The Crowfoot, Tiedemann, and Little Ice Age Advances were apparently of roughly the same magnitude. The latter was most extensive in most cases, but at several sites Crowfoot moraines lie slightly farther downvalley than Little Ice Age moraines. During the present century, ice-fronts have generally retreated (particularly rapidly in the period 1920-1950 A.D.), although rates of retreat have decreased in the last three decades and some glaciers have readvanced slightly. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The potential impacts of the future climate change on the causes of flood flows were investigated for two mountainous watersheds located in two different climatic regions of British Columbia. The Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling Analysis General Circulation Model (CGCMa1) has been used to estimate changes in the precipitation and temperature. The UBC Watershed Model (Version 4.0) was used to simulate the discharge of the two study watersheds and to identify the causes of peak flows. In the simulations, apart from changes in precipitation and temperature, changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, cloud cover, glacier extension, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production, and plant physiology were considered. The results showed that the future climate for the two study watersheds would be wetter and warmer than the present climate. The majority of the flood events in the coastal rainfed watershed of Upper Campbell are and would be generated by fall rainfall events and winter rain-on-snow events, whereas in the interior snowcovered Illecillewaet basin the floods are and would be produced by spring rain and snowmelt events and summer events. The analysis indicated that the overall flood magnitude and frequency of occurrence in the Upper Campbell watershed would increase. On the other hand, the number and the magnitude of the flood flows would decrease under the future climatic conditions in the Illecillewaet basin. Based on these findings, different management practices should be applied in the two watersheds to overcome the effects of the future climate change.},

abstract = {Turbidites embedded in lacustrine sediment sequences are commonly used to reconstruct regional flood or earthquake histories. A critical step for this method to be successful is that turbidites and their trigger mechanisms are determined unambiguously. The latter is particularly challenging for prehistoric proglacial lake records in high-seismicity settings where both earthquake-generated and flood-generated turbidites interrupt the background varved sedimentation. This calls for a new method to allow efficient and objective identification and classification of turbidites. This study examined turbidites in five long (9 to 17 m) sediment cores from Eklutna Lake, a proglacial lake in south-central Alaska, using standard core logging and grain-size data. A novel statistical approach is presented, in which varve-thickness distributions were first analyzed to objectively identify the thickest turbidites and distinguish them from background sedimentation. For each turbidite, a selection of variables were then measured, including: basal grain-size, thickness, magnetic susceptibility and spectrophotometric variables. Triggering mechanisms were discriminated by a combination of principal component analysis and clustering, and by calibration with historical events. Using this approach, a 2250 year long lake-wide event stratigraphy was constructed, with 94 prehistoric events, including 24 earthquake and 70 flood events. Basal grain-size and thickness variables turn out to be the most effective proxies for discrimination. This statistical approach is a powerful and new method to identify turbidites and their triggering mechanisms in long prehistoric sediment records. It opens up new prospects for palaeoseismological, palaeohydrological and palaeoclimate studies in proglacial lakes worldwide.},

abstract = {Sediment deposition in the coastal zone from riverine input is of key importance in understanding the construction of sediment sequences through time. A turbulent-jet model is used to simulate sediment input to the continental margin from a riverine source. Turbulent-jet models track the momentum, which is the first-order force carrying most of the sediment flowing into the ocean. The Froude number at the river mouth remains supercritical during floods of the Eel River, justifying the use of a jet model for the initial dispersion of the sediment-laden plume. Sediment is deposited from the plume prior to the centerline Froude number decreasing to its critical value. Empirically derived first-order removal-rate constants are used for each grain size in an advection–diffusion equation to predict the areal extent of sediment deposition. One strength of using a jet model is its ability to simulate deposits on a daily time-step over intermediate time scales (thousands of years) using a limited number of input parameters. A number of simulations of the Eel River plume are shown for conditions of the present day and 18,000 yr BP, during the last glacial maximum. The model results for modern conditions show that a majority of the deposition occurs within 20 km north of the river mouth and is typically confined to within 10 km of the coastline, corresponding well with the shelf sands on the Eel margin. However, the initial mud deposit from a 1995 flood was farther offshore and northward. Additional advection of the mud fraction must occur after it leaves the surficial plume and prior to its initial deposition. The model runs of 18,000 yr BP (with 100 m lower sea level, wetter and colder climate, and the river mouth assumed to be at the canyon) show that the plume is able to transport sand, silt and clay out of the canyon and onto the continental slope.},

Lake-based yields for the 1931-2001 period (0.21 ± 0.03 Mg km- 2day- 1) are 10% higher than estimates for the last 3000 years (0.19 ± 0.05 Mg km- 2day- 1). Fluvial (0.24 ± 0.08 Mg km- 2day- 1) and lake-based yields (ca. 0.21 ± 0.07 Mg km- 2day- 1) are comparable over the period of overlap (1999-2001). Persistence in the long-term yield record is dominated by low frequency (century to decadal) periodicity. This periodicity is shown to inflate the standard error of the sediment yield estimate for the basin. Elevated transport of suspended sediments following years of extreme yield is uncommon in the Green Lake record and indicates a sediment-transport regime that is supply limited. For this watershed approximately 50 years of suspended sediment monitoring would be required to reduce the uncertainty of the yield estimate to 37% of its average value.

These algorithms are unique in that they scale up the physics of interception and sublimation from small scales, where they are well understood, to forest stand-scale calculations of intercepted snow sublimation. Evaluation of results from the set of algorithms against measured interception and sublimation, in a southern boreal forest jack pine stand during late winter, found that the coupled model provides reasonable approximations of both interception and sublimation losses on half-hourly, daily and event bases. Cumulative errors in the estimate of intercepted snow load over 23 days of test were 0.06 mm SWE, with a standard deviation of 0.46 mm SWE. Sublimation losses during the evaluation were high, approximately two-thirds of snowfall within this period. Seasonal intercepted snow sublimation as a portion of annual snowfall at the model test site was lower than sublimation during the tests, ranging from 13% for a mixed spruce-aspen, 31% for the mature pine and 40% for a mature spruce stand. The results indicate that sublimation can be a significant abstraction of water from mature evergreen stands in northern forests and that the losses can be calculated by application of process-based algorithms.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) and melt are important for estimating areal melt rates and snow-cover depletion (SCD) dynamics but are rarely measured in detail during the late ablation period. This study contributes results from high-resolution observations made using large numbers of sequential aerial photographs taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle on an alpine ridge in the Fortress Mountain Snow Laboratory in the Canadian Rocky Mountains from May to July in 2015. Using structure-from-motion and thresholding techniques, spatial maps of snow depth, snow cover and differences in snow depth (dHS) during ablation were generated in very high resolution as proxies for spatial SWE, spatial ablation rates and SCD. The results indicate that the initial distribution of snow depth was highly variable due to overwinter snow redistribution; thus, the subsequent distribution of dHS was also variable due to albedo, slope/aspect and other unaccountable differences. However, the initial distribution of snow depth was 5 times more variable than that of the subsequent dHS values, which varied by a factor of 2 between the north and south aspects. dHS patterns were somewhat spatially persistent over time but had an insubstantial impact on SCD curves, which were overwhelmingly governed by the initial distribution of snow depth. The reason for this is that only a weak spatial correlation developed between the initial snow depth and dHS. Previous research has shown that spatial correlations between SWE and ablation rates can strongly influence SCD curves. Reasons for the lack of a correlation in this study area were analysed and a generalisation to other regions was discussed. The following questions were posed: what is needed for a large spatial correlation between initial snow depth and dHS? When should snow depth and dHS be taken into account to correctly model SCD? The findings of this study suggest that hydrological and atmospheric models need to incorporate realistic distributions of SWE, melt energy and cold content; therefore, they must account for realistic correlations (i.e. not too large or too small) between SWE and melt in order to accurately model SCD.},

abstract = {All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate-for example, on the frequency of heatwaves-this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability-predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions-are likely to be severe. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Riverbank retreat along a bend of the Cecina River, Tuscany (central Italy) was monitored across a near annual cycle (autumn 2003 to summer 2004) with the aim of better understanding the factors influencing bank changes and processes at a seasonal scale. Seven flow events occurred during the period of investigation, with the largest having an estimated return period of about 1{\textperiodcentered}5 years. Bank simulations were performed by linking hydrodynamic, fluvial erosion, groundwater flow and bank stability models, for the seven flow events, which are representative of the typical range of hydrographs that normally occur during an annual cycle. The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

abstract = {Within mountainous regions, estimating the exchange of sensible heat and water vapor between the surface and the atmosphere is an important but inexact endeavor. Measurements of the turbulence characteristics of the near-surface boundary layer in complex mountain terrain are relatively scarce, leading to considerable uncertainty in the application of flux-gradient techniques for estimating the surface turbulent heat and mass fluxes. An investigation of the near-surface boundary layer within a 7-ha snow-covered forest clearing was conducted in the Kananaskis River valley, located within the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The homogeneous measurement site was characterized as being relatively calm and sheltered; the wind exhibited considerable unsteadiness, however. Frequent wind gusts were observed to transport turbulent energy into the clearing, affecting the rate of energy transfer at the snow surface. The resulting boundary layer within the clearing exhibited perturbations introduced by the surrounding topography and land surface discontinuities. The measured momentum flux did not scale with the local aerodynamic roughness and mean wind speed profile, but rather was reflective of the larger-scale topographical disturbances. The intermittent nature of the fluxgenerating processes was evident in the turbulence spectra and cospectra where the peak energy was shifted to lower frequencies as compared with those observed in more homogeneous flat terrain. The contribution of intermittent events was studied using quadrant analysis, which revealed that 50% of the sensible and latent heat fluxes was contributed from motions that occupied less than 6% of the time. These results highlight the need for caution while estimating the turbulent heat and mass fluxes in mountain regions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The physical significance of a negative correlation between a varve record from Mud Lake, British Columbia, and temperature is discussed in the context of a process-network. The process-network is defined as the system of temporally and spatially connected processes involved in the transfer of a signal from climate to varved glaciolacustrine sediment. The six systems defining the network include climate, glacier, fluvial, geomorphic, terrestrial biologic and lacustrine systems to which each process belongs. A literature review outlines significant variation in the strength and character of correlations between components of the process-network and highlights that more comprehensive interpretations of varves as a hydroclimatic proxy require an improved understanding of the process-network. Documenting each process in the network is integral to informing a more complete model of this system, identifying processes that constitute signal transfer and assessing hydroclimatic proxies based on linear correlation. Such documentation is of growing importance as varved lacustrine sediments are increasingly used as a hydroclimatic proxy. The complex nature of the process-network requires greater emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation and alternative methods to the linear statistical model.},

abstract = {A comprehensive, physically based model of snow accumulation, redistribution, sublimation, and melt for open and forested catchments was assembled, based on algorithms derived from hydrological process research in Russia and Canada. The model was used to evaluate the long-term snow dynamics of a forested and an agricultural catchment in northwestern Russia without calibration from snow observations. The model was run with standard meteorological variables for the two catchments, and its results were tested against regular surface observations of snow accumulation throughout the winter and spring period for 17 seasons. The results showed mean errors in comparison to observations of less than 3% in estimating snow water equivalent during the winter and melt seasons. Snow surface evaporation and blowing snow were found to be small components of the mass balance, but intercepted snow sublimation removed notable amounts of snow over the winter from the forested catchment. Average snow accumulation was 15% higher in the open catchment, largely due to a lack of intercepted snow sublimation. Melt rates were 23% higher in the open than in the forest, but the effect on melt duration was suppressed by the smaller premelt accumulation in the forest. Only a moderate sensitivity of snow accumulation to forest leaf area was found, while a substantial variation was observed from season to season with changing weather patterns. This suggests that the ensemble of snow processes is more sensitive to variations in atmospheric processes than in vegetation cover. The success in using algorithms from both Canada and Russia in modeling snow dynamics suggests that there may be a potential for large-scale transferability of the modeling techniques. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

Process-based land surface models are well suited to address these complex and emerging global change problems but will require extensive development and evaluation. The coupled Canadian Land Surface Scheme and Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CLASS-CTEM) framework has been under continuous development by Environment and Climate Change Canada since 1987. As the open-source model of code development has revolutionized the software industry, scientific software is experiencing a similar evolution. Given the scale of the challenge facing land surface modellers, and the benefits of open-source, or community model, development, we have transitioned CLASS-CTEM from an internally developed model to an open-source community model, which we call the Canadian Land Surface Scheme including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC) v.1.0. CLASSIC contains many technical features specifically designed to encourage community use including software containerization for serial and parallel simulations, extensive benchmarking software and data (Automated Model Benchmarking; AMBER), self-documenting code, community standard formats for model inputs and outputs, amongst others. Here, we evaluate and benchmark CLASSIC against 31 FLUXNET sites where the model has been tailored to the site-level conditions and driven with observed meteorology. Future versions of CLASSIC will be developed using AMBER and these initial benchmark results to evaluate model performance over time. CLASSIC remains under active development and the code, site-level benchmarking data, software container, and AMBER are freely available for community use.},

abstract = {Hydrological processes over and through frozen and unfrozen ground were simulated in the well instrumented boreal forest basin of White Gull Creek, Saskatchewan, Canada using a model created using the flexible Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform. The CRHM-created Boreal Hydrology Model was structured and initially parameterized using decades of process hydrology research in the southern boreal forest with minor parameter calibration, and generally produced quite good performance on simultaneously reproducing the measurements of runoff, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil liquid water content and eddy correlation flux tower observations of evapotranspiration (ET) over two decades. To examine the sensitivity of basin hydrology to perturbed climate inputs, air temperature (T) inputs were set up by linear increments in the reference observation of up to +6 ℃, and precipitation (P) inputs were generated by multiplying the reference observed P from 70% to 130%. The model results showed that the basin hydrological variables showed quite different sensitivities to perturbations of P and T. The volume of annual runoff and the annual runoff coefficient increased more rapidly with rising P, at rates of 31% and 16% per 10% increase in P, but decreased by only 3.8% and 4.7% per 1 ℃ of warming. Annual ET increased rapidly with temperature, by 7% per 1 ℃ of warming and therefore drove the streamflow volumetric changes with warming, but increased only 1% per 10% increase in P. Perturbations of P and T had distinctively different influences on the streamflow regime. Increased P enhanced the intra- and inter-annual variabilities of basin runoff, reduced the relative contribution of winter runoff to annual runoff and increased the relative contribution of summer runoff; whilst rising T resulted in the inverse changes in the streamflow regime. Effects of warming on some hydrological processes could be compensated for to varying degrees by the effects of increases in P. Reductions in the annual runoff volume and runoff coefficient caused by warming up to 6 ℃ could be compensated for by increases of <20% in P. However, the maximum increase in P (+30%) examined could only compensate for the changes in snow processes caused by warming of less than 4 ℃ and snow-cover duration decreases with 1 ℃ warming could not be compensated for by any precipitation increase considered. These results inform the vulnerability of boreal forest hydrology to the first-order changes in P and T and provide guidance for further climate impact assessments for hydrology in the southern boreal forest in Canada.},

abstract = {Modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of snow in forests is challenging, as involved processes are strongly dependent on small-scale canopy properties. In this study, we explore how local canopy structure information can be integrated in a medium-complexity energy balance snow model to replicate observed snow patterns at very high spatial resolutions. Snow depth distributions simulated with the Flexible Snow Model (FSM2) were tested against extensive experimental data acquired in discontinuous subalpine forest stands in Eastern Switzerland over three winters. While the default canopy implementation in FSM2 fails to capture the observed snow depth variability, performance is considerably improved when local canopy cover fraction and hemispherical sky view fraction are additionally accounted for (30% reduction in root mean square error). However, realistic snow depth distribution patterns throughout the season are only achieved if effective temperatures of near and distant canopy elements are discerned and if a mechanism to mimic preferential deposition of snow in canopy gaps is included. We demonstrate that by diversifying the canopy structure input in order to reflect respective portions of the canopy relevant to different processes, even a simple model based on widely used process parameterizations and canopy metrics can be applied for high-resolution simulations of the sub-canopy snow cover with just a few modifications. The presented approaches could be implemented in commonly used land surface models, allowing upscaling experiments and development of sub-grid parameterizations without necessitating complex high-resolution models.},

abstract = {Spatially distributed rainfall–runoff models, made feasible by the widespread availability of land surface characteristics data (especially digital topography), and the evolution of high power desktop workstations, are particularly useful for assessment of the hydrological effects of land surface change. Three examples are provided of the use of the Distributed Hydrology‐Soil–Vegetation Model (DHSVM) to assess the hydrological effects of logging in the Pacific Northwest. DHSVM provides a dynamic representation of the spatial distribution of soil moisture, snow cover, evapotranspiration and runoff production, at the scale of digital topographic data (typically 30–100 m). Among the hydrological concerns that have been raised related to forest harvest in the Pacific Northwest are increases in flood peaks owing to enhanced rain‐on‐snow and spring radiation melt response, and the effects of forest roads. The first example is for two rain‐on‐snow floods in the North Fork Snoqualmie River during November 1990 and December 1989. Predicted maximum vegetation sensitivities (the difference between predicted peaks for all mature vegetation compared with all clear‐cut) showed a 31% increase in the peak runoff for the 1989 event and a 10% increase for the larger 1990 event. The main reason for the difference in response can be traced to less antecedent low elevation snow during the 1990 event. The second example is spring snowmelt runoff for the Little Naches River, Washington, which drains the east slopes of the Washington Cascades. Analysis of spring snowmelt peak runoff during May 1993 and April 1994 showed that, for current vegetation relative to all mature vegetation, increases in peak spring stream flow of only about 3% should have occurred over the entire basin. However, much larger increases (up to 30%) would occur for a maximum possible harvest scenario, and in a small headwaters catchment, whose higher elevation leads to greater snow coverage (and, hence, sensitivity to vegetation change) during the period of maximum runoff. The third example, Hard and Ware Creeks, Washington, illustrates the effects of forest roads in two heavily logged small catchments on the western slopes of the Cascades. Use of DHSVM's road runoff algorithm shows increases in peak runoff for the five largest events in 1992 (average observed stream flow of 2{\textperiodcentered}1 m3 s−1) averaging 17{\textperiodcentered}4% for Hard Creek and 16{\textperiodcentered}2% for Ware Creek, with a maximum percentage increase (for the largest event, in Hard Creek) of 27%. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The spatial variability of these turbulent fluxes across a basin and the relative importance of the differences is not well known. This paper specifically addresses small-scale variabilities in sensible and latent energy fluxes related to topographically induced wind speed variations. A simple wind model was used to simulate topographic effects on the surface wind field. Hourly wind observations were areally distributed by the model and used to calculate spatially variable sensible and latent turbulent heat fluxes for a small (63 km2) research catchment dominated by open tundra vegetation. Simulations showed that, even though the study area is characterized by relatively low relief (average slope 3°), the small-scale sensible and latent heat fluxes varied considerably throughout the basin. The resulting variations in snowmelt rates play an important role in the development of a patchy snow cover. Overall, turbulent fluxes within the research area varied by as much as 20% from the mean, leading to differences in potential snowmelt of up to 70 mm snow water equivalent over the entire melt period. {\textcopyright} 2006 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

It appears likely from the cases studied that accurate timing of venting or sluicing operations to intercept gravity underflows can treble or quadruple the amount of sediment discharged from a reservoir. Desilting basins, because of their shape and method of operation, may have trap efficiencies above 90% even with very low C/I ratios. Semi-dry reservoirs with high C/I ratios, like John Martin Reservoir, may have trap efficiencies as low as 60%. Truly "dry" reservoirs, such as those in the Miami Conservancy District, probably have trap efficiencies in the 10 to 40% range, depending upon C/I ratio},

abstract = {Climates at the global, the regional, and the local scale determine the relative contributions of radiation, turbulent and mass fluxes to the corresponding balance at the atmosphere-ground interface. Presence of a snow cover changes the physical properties of the atmosphere-ground interface, which in turn affects the above fluxes, thereby influencing the properties of the lower atmosphere. In addition, fluxes involved at the snow-atmosphere interface depend much on the ground vegetation, on the snow cover being continuous or patchy as well as on topography. This chapter first presents general equations for both energy and mass balances (Section 3.2). Detailed discussions of each component of the energy balance follow (Section 3.3), including effects due to either vegetation or topography. Next, the influence of vegetation, blowing snow, as well as topography, on snow accumulation is treated (Section 3.4), including some considerations of the coupling of energy and mass balances. Finally, in order to give the reader a sense of the magnitude of the fluxes involved, some examples are presented (Section 3.5), considering either daily averages over typical periods (season) or the processes in detail. Energy balance is often formulated in terms of energy exchanges taking place at an interface (see e.g. Oke, 1987). Such an active surface has to be thought of as being infinitesimally thin and having neither mass nor specific heat.

abstract = {Thirteen equations based on the mass-transfer method for determining free water evaporation were expressed in seven generalized equations. These seven equations were then compared with pan evaporation at four climatological stations in north-western Ontario, Canada. The comparisons were based on monthly evaporation. Equations were compared by calibrating them on the entire data sets as well as by calibrating on part of the data and then verifying them on the remainder of the data. The results of comparison showed that all equations were in reasonable agreement with observed evaporation, and that the effect of wind velocity on monthly evaporation was marginal. However, when an equation with parameters obtained at one site was applied to compute evaporation at another site, the computed evaporation was not in good agreement with observed values. {\textcopyright} 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

To establish these laws, the authors have summarized previous studies on temperature gradient and on wet-snow metamorphism and they have also conducted metamorphism experiments on dry or wet fresh-snow samples. An original formalism was developed to allow a description of snow with parameters evolving continuously throughout time. The introduction of laws of metamorphism has improved significantly the derivation of the settlement of internal layers and of snow-covered albedo, which depend on the simulated stratigraphy, i.e. the type and size of snow grains of different layers of the snow cover. The model was tested during a whole winter season without any re-initialization. Comparison between the simulated characteristics of the snow cover and the observations made in the field are described in detail. The model proved itself to be very efficient in simulating accurately the evolution of the snow-cover stratigraphy throughout the whole winter season.},

abstract = {There is general consensus that projected warming will cause earlier snowmelt, but how snowmelt rates will respond to climate change is poorly known. We present snowpack observations from western North America illustrating that shallower snowpack melts earlier, and at lower rates, than deeper, later-lying snow-cover. The observations provide the context for a hypothesis of slower snowmelt in a warmer world. We test this hypothesis using climate model simulations for both a control time period and re-run with a future climate scenario, and find that the fraction of meltwater volume produced at high snowmelt rates is greatly reduced in a warmer climate. The reduction is caused by a contraction of the snowmelt season to a time of lower available energy, reducing by as much as 64% the snow-covered area exposed to energy sufficient to drive high snowmelt rates. These results have unresolved implications on soil moisture deficits, vegetation stress, and streamflow declines.},

abstract = {This paper reviews measurement techniques and corresponding devices used to determine the physical properties of the seasonal snowpack from distances close to the ground surface. The review is placed in the context of the need for scientific observations of snowpack variables that provide inputs for predictive hydrological models that help to advance scientific understanding of geophysical processes related to snow in the near-surface cryosphere. Many of these devices used to measure snow are invasive and require the snowpack to be disrupted, thereby precluding the possibility for multiple measurements to be made at the same sampling location. Moreover, many devices rely on the use of empirical calibration equations that may not be valid at all geographic locations. The spatial density of observations with most snow measurement devices is often inadequate. There is a need for improved automation of snowpack measurement instrumentation with an emphasis on field-based feedback of measurement validity in lieu of postprocessing of samples or data at a lab or office location. The scientific future of snow measurement instrumentation thereby requires a synthesis between science and engineering principles that takes into consideration geophysics and the physics of device operation.},

abstract = {British Columbia was almost completely glaciated during Late Wisconsinan and consequently little is known about the history or extent of earlier Quaternary glaciations. Stratigraphical sections do, however, contain evidence of glacial deposits that are as old as 4 Ma. The cooling leading to Late Wisconsinan glaciation in British Columbia began about 29 ka. At the climax of the Late Wisconsinan Fraser Glaciation, British Columbia, with the exception of a few small nunataks, was covered by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. This was a coalescent mass of glaciers and icefields with complex flow directions controlled, in part by the locations of relatively high ‘ice-sheds' over the plateaux of the interior. Late Wisconsinan deglaciation began about 14.5 ka, and the ensuing retreat was relatively rapid. In general frontal recession was the dominant mode of deglaciation in the marginal areas, however, downwasting was the prime mode of deglaciation across most of the province. Downwasting resulted in gradual lowering of the ice surface which led to systematic early exposure of higher areas, disrupting glacier flow patterns, and starving thick ice masses that remained in low-lying areas. In many places, this mode of deglaciation resulted in formation of abundant meltwater channels, numerous glacial lakes in valleys blocked by remnant ice, and widespread ice-stagnation features. By 10 ka, ice cover in British Columbia was approximately as extensive as at present.},

abstract = {Environment and Climate Change Canada has initiated the production of a 1980-2018, 10ĝ€¯km, North American precipitation and surface reanalysis. ERA-Interim is used to initialize the Global Deterministic Reforecast System (GDRS) at a 39ĝ€¯km resolution. Its output is then dynamically downscaled to 10ĝ€¯km by the Regional Deterministic Reforecast System (RDRS). Coupled with the RDRS, the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) and Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) are used to produce surface and precipitation analyses. All systems used are close to operational model versions and configurations. In this study, a 7-year sample of the reanalysis (2011-2017) is evaluated. Verification results show that the skill of the RDRS is stable over time and equivalent to that of the current operational system. The impact of the coupling between RDRS and CaLDAS is explored using an early version of the reanalysis system which was run at 15ĝ€¯km resolution for the period 2010-2014, with and without the use of CaLDAS. Significant improvements are observed with CaLDAS in the lower troposphere and surface layer, especially for the 850ĝ€¯hPa dew point and absolute temperatures in summer. Precipitation is further improved through an offline precipitation analysis which allows the assimilation of additional observations of 24ĝ€¯h precipitation totals. The final dataset should be of particular interest for hydrological applications focusing on transboundary and northern watersheds, where existing products often show discontinuities at the border and assimilate very few - if any - precipitation observations.},

abstract = {We derived and implemented two spatial models of May snow water equivalent (SWE) at Lee Ridge in Glacier National Park, Montana. We used the models to test the hypothesis that vegetation structure is a control on snow redistribution at the alpine treeline ecotone (ATE). The statistical models were derived using stepwise and "best" subsets regression techniques. The first model was derived from field measurements of SWE, topography, and vegetation taken at 27 sample points. The second model was derived using GIS-based measures of topography and vegetation. Both the field- (R2 = 0.93) and GIS-based models (R2 = 0.69) of May SWE included the following variables: site type (based on vegetation), elevation, maximum slope, and general slope aspect. Site type was identified as the most important predictor of SWE in both models, accounting for 74.0% and 29.5% of the variation, respectively. The GIS-based model was applied to create a predictive map of SWE across Lee Ridge, predicting little snow accumulation on the top of the ridge where vegetation is scarce. The GIS model failed in large depressions, including ephemeral stream channels. The models supported the hypothesis that upright vegetation has a positive effect on accumulation of SWE above and beyond the effects of topography. Vegetation, therefore, creates a positive feedback in which it modifies its environment and could affect the ability of additional vegetation to become established. {\textcopyright} 2005 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

abstract = {Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30–40% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow-cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land-surface data to flag snow-cloud identification errors and improve snow-map accuracy reducing bias by 20% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow-mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow-dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow-covered areas.},

abstract = {In recent years, climate change impacts on water resources sectors have been extensively documented. Anticipated changes range from more severe storms to more frequent floods and drought at regional scale. Pressure on water resources and hence on the environment will probably increase with the need of quality data for sustainable design of water resources projects. Therefore, for an optimal network design, hydrometric networks are to be reviewed periodically based on the information needs of the various end users and the perspective for future water resources development. This paper evaluates hydrometric networks to identify essential streamflow stations and critical areas (highly poor network density) within major watersheds across the different provinces of Canada using entropy theory. The method is applied to daily streamflow data and information coefficients such as marginal entropy, joint entropy and transinformation index are used for the identification of important stations as well as critical areas in the basin. The analysis results show that almost all Canadian main watersheds contain deficient hydrometric networks. The most deficient streamflow networks are identified in Alberta (North Saskatchewan, Oldman, and Red Deer basins), Northern Ontario (Hudson Bay basin), and the Northwest Territories. The information might prove to be helpful for decision makers to undertake cost-benefit analyses for hydrometric network updating in each region. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Formation of annually laminated sediments in Summit Lake, White Pass, British Columbia is controlled by runoff generated by snowpack and glacier melt and major rainfall events. The 700-yr varve record is divided into two subannual series (early and late) based on sedimentological criteria and sedimentary structures within each varve. A comparison of recent subannual laminae with nearby meteorological records supports the interpretation they are formed by river discharge events generated by major snow and glacier melt events and large late-summer rainfall events. A significant correlation exists between the late subannual thickness series and the size of the largest rainfall events in late summer. The long record indicates there was an abrupt increase in the thickness and frequency of major rainfall-induced sedimentary events at the end of the seventeenth century. In addition, the frequency of laminae generated by early runoff events also increased. However, early subannual varve thickness component remains statistically the same as the thickness prior to the end of the seventeenth century. This suggests the change in varve thickness at this time is due to increases in major late-summer rainfall frequency rather than increased sediment availability caused by regional Little Ice Age glacier advances. {\textcopyright} 2006 University of Washington.},

The dual crop coefficient sKcd method of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United States (FAO) Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (FAO-56) is intended to improve daily simulation of crop ET by considering separately the contribution of evaporation from soil. The dual method utilizes basal crop coefficients representing ET from crops having a dry soil surface and separately predicts evaporation from bare soil based on a water balance of the soil surface layer. Three extensions to the evaporation calculation procedure are described here that are intended to improve accuracy when applications warrant the extra complexity. The first extension uses parallel water balances representing the portion of the soil surface wetted by irrigation and precipitation together and the portion wetted by precipitation alone. The second extension uses three stages for surface drying and provides for application to deep cracking soils. The third extension predicts the extraction of the transpiration component from the soil surface layer. Sensitivity and analyses and illustrations indicate moderate sensitivity of daily calculated ET to application of the extensions. The dual Kc procedure, although relatively simple computationally and structurally, estimates daily ET as measured by lysimeter relatively well for periods of bare soil and partial and full vegetation cover.},

Information on the timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or changing climate conditions is required for successful water and resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model ISNOBAL is used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km2, with simulation periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and watershed management.},

The metrics were meant to estimate size and relative location of gap openings around a point within forested areas, allowing for measures of the spatial arrangement of surrounding canopy elements. These new metrics were correlated with snow interception measured in the field (8488 manually measured snow interception points). The results were further compared to the correlation values between effective interception and traditionally used forest parameters (CC and LAI). The correspondence between all metrics was also analyzed in order to understand the potential cross correlation between each variable. LAI (average R: 0.57) demonstrated low correlations when directly compared to snow interception and further showed a large cross correlation with canopy closure (average R: 0.72). A new metric, 'mean distance to canopy' had the highest correlation (average R: 0.78) over all storm events to the effective interception. But in contrast to LAI, this metric did not show any cross correlation with canopy closure (CC). Likewise, 'total gap area,' an indirect measurement of apparent gap fraction (another new metric), also showed a high correlation to effective interception (average R: 0.72) without demonstrating a significant cross correlation to CC or to mean distance to canopy. These findings suggest that modeling forest snow processes with both CC and LAI may not be the best option due to both the low correlation of LAI as well as high cross correlation between these parameters. However, the pairing of mean distance to canopy and/or total gap area with canopy closure could give more robust estimations of snow interception within heterogeneous terrain.},

abstract = {Vegetation has a tremendous influence on snow processes and snowpack dynamics, yet remote sensing techniques to resolve the spatial variability of sub-canopy snow depth are not always available and are difficult from spacebased platforms. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have had recent widespread application to capture high-resolution information on snow processes and are herein applied to the sub-canopy snow depth challenge. Previous demonstrations of snow depth mapping with UAV structure from motion (SfM) and airborne lidar have focussed on non-vegetated surfaces or reported large errors in the presence of vegetation. In contrast, UAV-lidar systems have high-density point clouds and measure returns from a wide range of scan angles, increasing the likelihood of successfully sensing the subcanopy snow depth. The effectiveness of UAV lidar and UAV SfM in mapping snow depth in both open and forested terrain was tested in a 2019 field campaign at the Canadian Rockies Hydrological Observatory, Alberta, and at Canadian prairie sites near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Only UAV lidar could successfully measure the sub-canopy snow surface with reliable sub-canopy point coverage and consistent error metrics (root mean square error (RMSE) <0:17 m and bias-0:03 to-0:13 m). Relative to UAV lidar, UAV SfM did not consistently sense the sub-canopy snow surface, the interpolation needed to account for point cloud gaps introduced interpolation artefacts, and error metrics demonstrated relatively large variability (RMSE<0:33 m and bias 0.08 to-0:14 m). With the demonstration of sub-canopy snow depth mapping capabilities, a number of early applications are presented to showcase the ability of UAV lidar to effectively quantify the many multiscale snow processes defining snowpack dynamics in mountain and prairie environments.},

abstract = {Modeling of complex hydrologic processes has resulted in models that themselves exhibit a high degree of complexity and that require the determination of various parameters through calibration. In the current application we introduce a relatively new global optimization tool, called particle swarm optimization (PSO), that has already been applied in various other fields and has been reported to show effective and efficient performance. The PSO approach initially dealt with a single-objective function but has been extended to deal with multiobjectives in a form called multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The algorithm is modified to account for multiobjective problems by introducing the Pareto rank concept. The new MOPSO algorithm is tested on three case studies. Two test functions are used as the first case study to generate the true Pareto fronts. The approach is further tested for parameter estimation of a well-known conceptual rainfall-runoff model, the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model having 13 parameters, for which the results are very encouraging. We also tested the MOPSO algorithm to calibrate a three-parameter support vector machine model for soil moisture prediction. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Observations suggest that 25-45% of the annual snowfall can sublimate from coniferous canopies in cold, dry continental environments. A similar range of simulated sublimation fractions is found for the forested fractions of continental gridboxes, but the sublimation is likely to be overestimated in maritime environments due to the neglect of canopy snow unloading.},

abstract = {Abstract Castle Creek Glacier in the Cariboo Mountains of British Columbia remained close to its Little Ice Age limit for most of the past 1500 years, without significant recession until the 20th century. This conclusion is based on radiocarbon-dated detrital and in-situ plant material overrun by the glacier, and the sedimentary record from informally named On–off Lake, which received clastic sediments only when Castle Creek Glacier crossed a hydrologic divide 330 m upvalley of the Little Ice Age limit. Plant macrofossils recovered from the transition between basal inorganic silt and overlying organic silty clay in a sediment core from the lake indicate that the glacier first retreated behind the divide ca. 10.92–9.70 ka. Ages of 8.97–8.61 and 5.58–5.53 ka on detrital wood from the glacier's forefield may record earlier advances, but the first unequivocal evidence of glacier expansion is from an overridden stump with an age of 4.96–4.45 ka. Continuous accumulation of gyttja within On–off Lake, however, indicates that Castle Creek Glacier did not cross the hydrologic divide at any time during the first half of the Holocene. Glacigenic sediments began to accumulate in the lake between 2.73 and 2.49 ka, indicating that Castle Creek Glacier expanded beyond the hydrologic divide at that time. A coincident advance is also recorded in the northern Rocky Mountains of British Columbia at Kwadacha Glacier, which overran a vegetated surface at 2.69–2.36 ka. Clastic sedimentation in On–off Lake ceased soon after the Bridge River volcanic eruption (2.70–2.35 ka), indicating that Castle Creek glacier retreat to a position upvalley of the divide at that time. Sedimentation resumed before 1.87–1.72 ka when the glacier advanced again past the hydrologic divide. Following a second retreat, Castle Creek Glacier advanced across the divide a final time at ca. 1.54–1.42 ka. The snout of the glacier remained less than 330 m upvalley of the Little Ice Age moraine until the early twentieth century when annual moraines indicate rapid frontal recession to a position upvalley of the hydrologic divide. These data collectively indicate that glaciers in the Cariboo Mountains of British Columbia nearly achieved their all-time Holocene limits as early as 2.73–2.49 ka and climatic conditions in the early 20th century abruptly ended a 1500-year period favoring glacier expansion.},

@article{Jost2007,
abstract = {Snow accumulation and melt are the two most important processes contributing to the spring freshet, the main hydrological event in snow-dominated watersheds. The magnitude and timing of the spring freshet is determined by the spatial variability of melt rates and peak snow water equivalent (SWE). Although it is known that the spatial variability of SWE is controlled by topography and vegetation, their combined influence on snow accumulation and melt at the watershed-scale has only been addressed in a few studies. The high small-scale variability of a snowpack combined with the classical sampling technique along transects makes it difficult to estimate how much of the observed spatial variability in SWE can be attributed to topographic and vegetative controls such as elevation, aspect, wind, and forest type, and how much of it is local variability. A nested stratified sampling design was developed for the snow courses in this study, where small-scale variability at the plot-scale was integrated by 12 snow density and 60 snow depth measurements, while the variability at the watershed-scale was captured by 19 strata, defined by elevation, aspect, and forest cover (either clearcut or forest). Snow course sampling was carried out during the spring of 2005, a year with 25% below average snow accumulation, and in spring of 2006, a year with 25% above average snow accumulation for the region. Snow accumulation in both years and snowmelt for a period in the spring of 2006 are analysed with multiple linear regressions and spatial autocorrelation of SWE with variogram analysis. The combination of elevation, aspect, and forest cover explained about 80-90% of the large-scale variability in snow accumulation for both years. At the plot-scale the coefficient of variation was higher under the forest canopy than in clearcuts, but did not relate to topographic controls. Elevation had the greatest influence on SWE in both years, with a steeper gradient in the snow rich year, whereas aspect had a similar effect in both years. In the mild winter of 2005, forests accumulated 39% less snow than clearcuts, while in 2006, forests had 27% less snow than clearcuts. Relative to the mean, aspect had a greater influence on snow accumulation than forest cover in the mild winter of 2005. Elevation played the most important role in snowmelt, while both aspect and forest cover had a comparable effect with slightly less influence than elevation. Almost all variograms show a clear sill, confirming that in the majority of cases, a 60 × 60 m plot size was adequate in capturing the variability of the plot-scale. In general, the degree of spatial autocorrelations is persistent in the snowmelt season for both years. This study has shown that it is possible to separate large-scale variability created by topography and forest cover from plot-scale variability through specifically designed snow surveys. The methods and data set of this study are useful in testing spatially-distributed snowmelt models and in developing new algorithms that reflect the relationships between the factors controlling the spatial variability of SWE. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Purpose – Development of competencies needed to be effective managers and leaders requires research and theory that can drive future scholarship and application. This introductory essay to this special issue of JMD seeks to focus on competencies in organizations in Europe and a broader conceptualization of emotional intelligence. Design/methodology/approach – Competencies are defined and an overview is provided for the papers that will follow with original research on competencies, their link to performance in various occupations, and their development. Findings – Emotional, social and cognitive intelligence competencies predict effectiveness in professional, management and leadership roles in many sectors of society. It addition, these competencies can be developed in adults. Research limitations/implications – As an introductory essay, the paper lays the foundation for the following papers in this issue. Practical implications – Competencies needed in order to be effective can be developed. Originality/value – Despite widespread application, there are few published studies of the empirical link between competencies and performance. There are even fewer published studies showing that they can be developed. The special issue will add to both literatures. There is widespread confusion as to the definition of emotional intelligence; the paper offers some clarification. {\textcopyright} 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract = {Snow is a porous medium made mostly of air and ice, whose transformation at the Earth's surface (qv Transformations of Snow at the Earth's Surface and its Climatic and Environmental Consequences) is greatly affected by climatic variables. Because a snow cover is present in a wide range of climates, from temperate to polar, the physical properties of snow show wide ranges of values: density values varies by a factor of 60, thermal conductivity values by a factor of 25, specific surface area (and effective grain size) by a factor of 80. These properties in turn also affect the reactivity of impurities contained in snow, so that snow physical and chemical properties are linked. Snow therefore interacts with environmental chemistry and climate. It is an environmental compartment that deserves detailed description for complete studies in natural sciences.},

abstract = {A number of reconstructions of millennial-scale climate variability have been carried out in order to understand patterns of natural climate variability, on decade to century timescales, and the role of anthropogenic forcing. These reconstructions have mainly used tree-ring data and other data sets of annual to decadal resolution. Lake and ocean sediments have a lower time resolution, but provide climate information at multicentennial timescales that may not be captured by tree-ring data. Here we reconstruct Northern Hemisphere temperatures for the past 2,000 years by combining low-resolution proxies with tree-ring data, using a wavelet transform technique to achieve timescale-dependent processing of the data. Our reconstruction shows larger multicentenniai variability than most previous multi-proxy reconstructions, but agrees well with temperatures reconstructed from borehole measurements and with temperatures obtained with a general circulation model. According to our reconstruction, high temperatures-similar to those observed in the twentieth century before 1990-occurred around AD 1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures that are about 0.7 K below the average of 1961-90 occurred around AD 1600.

abstract = {An accurate forecast of river stage is very significant so that there is ample time for the pertinent authority to issue a forewarning of the impending flood and to implement early evacuation measures as required. Since a variety of existing process-based hydrological models involve exogenous input and different assumptions, artificial neural networks have the potential to be a cost-effective solution. In this paper, a split-step particle swarm optimization (PSO) model is developed and applied to train multi-layer perceptrons for forecasting real-time water levels at Fo Tan in Shing Mun River of Hong Kong with different lead times on the basis of the upstream gauging station (Tin Sum) or at Fo Tan. This paradigm is able to combine the advantages of global search capability of PSO algorithm in the first step and local fast convergence of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the second step. The results demonstrate that it is able to attain a higher accuracy in a much shorter time when compared with the benchmarking backward propagation algorithm as well as the standard PSO algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Tropical glaciology includes investigation of climate variability in poorly documented regions of large surface-atmosphere energy exchanges. This study examines the surface energy fluxes of the Bolivian Zongo Glacier (16°S, 68°W, 6000-4900 m asl) in order to identify the atmospheric variables that control melting. Measurements from 1998 to 2000 taken from two meteorological stations in the ablation area are analyzed. During the progressive development of the wet season from September to January, melting energy was high: Solar irradiance was close to its summer solstice peak, clouds were sporadic, and albedo was low. During the core of the wet season from January to April the magnitudes of the net short-wave (+) and net long-wave (-) radiation fluxes were reduced by frequent clouds and snowfalls so that melting energy was moderate. In the dry season from May to August, melting energy was small because of the energy losses essentially in long-wave radiation but also in sublimation. The turbulent sensible heat flux to the ice (+) generally offsets the energy loss in latent heat (-), except in the dry season, when sublimation prevailed because of strong wind and dry air. Solar radiation was the main source of energy, but the seasonal changes of the melting energy were driven by long-wave radiation. In particular, clouds sharply increased the emittance of the thin high-altitude atmosphere. Closely linked to clouds and humidity, the main seasonal variables of low-latitude climates, long-wave radiation is a key variable in the energy balance of tropical glaciers.

abstract = {A study of the freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) has been carried out. Using available streamgage data, regression equations were developed for monthly flows. These equations express discharge as a function of basin physical characteristics such as area, mean elevation, and land cover, and of basin meteorological characteristics such as temperature, precipitation, and accumulated water year precipitation. To provide the necessary input meteorological data, temperature and precipitation data for a 40 year hind-cast period were developed on high-spatial-resolution grids using weather station data, PRISM climatologies, and statistical downscaling methods. Runoff predictions from the equations were found to agree well with observations. Once developed, the regression equations were applied to a network of delineated watersheds spanning the entire GOA drainage basin. The region was divided into a northern region, ranging from the Aleutian Chain to the Alaska/Canada border in the southeast panhandle, and a southern region, ranging from there to the Fraser River. The mean annual runoff volume into the northern GOA region was found to be 792 ± 120 km3 yr-1. A water balance using MODIS-based evapotranspiration rates yielded seasonal storage volumes that were consistent with GRACE satellite-based estimates. The GRACE data suggest that an additional 57 ± 11 km3 yr-1 be added to the runoff from the northern region, due to glacier volume loss (GVL) in recent years. This yields a total value of 849 ± 121 km3 yr-1. The ease of application of the derived regression equations provides an accessible tool for quantifying mean annual values, seasonal variation, and interannual variability of runoff in any ungaged basin of interest.},

abstract = {We present a significant update to a millennial summer temperature reconstruction (1073–1983) that was originally published in 1997. Utilising new tree-ring data (predominantly Piceaengelmannii), the reconstruction is not only better replicated, but has been extended (950–1994) and is now more regionally representative. Calibration and verification statistics were improved, with the new model explaining 53% of May–August maximum temperature variation compared to the original (39% of April–August mean temperatures). The maximum latewood density data, which are weighted more strongly in the regression model than ringwidth, were processed using regional curve standardisation to capture potential centennial to millennial scale variability. The reconstruction shows warm intervals, comparable to twentieth century values, for the first half of the eleventh century, the late 1300s and early 1400s. The bulk of the record, however, is below the 1901–1980 normals, with prolonged cool periods from 1200 to 1350 and from 1450 to the late 19th century. The most extreme cool period is observed to be in the 1690s. These reconstructed cool periods compare well with known regional records of glacier advances between 1150 and the 1300s, possibly in the early 1500s, early 1700s and 1800s. Evidence is also presented of the influence of solar activity and volcanic events on summer temperature in the Canadian Rockies over the last 1,000 years. Although this reconstruction is regional in scope, it compares well at multi-decadal to centennial scales with Northern Hemisphere temperature proxies and at millennial scales with reconstructions that were also processed to capture longer timescale variability. This coherence suggests that this series is globally important for the assessment of natural temperature variability over the last 1,000 years.},

abstract = {Transportation, sublimation and accumulation of snow dominate snow cover development in the Arctic and produce episodic high evaporative fluxes. Unfortunately, blowing snow processes are not presently incorporated in any hydrological or meteorological models. To demonstrate the application of simple algorithms that represent blowing snow processes, monthly snow accumulation, relocation and sublimation fluxes were calculated and applied in a spatially distributed manner to a 68-km2 catchment in the low Arctic of north-western Canada. The model uses a Landsat-derived vegetation classification and a digital elevation model to segregate the basin into snow 'sources' and 'sinks'. The model then relocates snow from sources to sinks and calculates in-transit sublimation loss. The resulting annual snow accumulation in specific landscape types was compared with the result of intensive surveys of snow depth and density. On an annual basis, 28% of annual snowfall sublimated from tundra surfaces whilst 18% was transported to sink areas. Annual blowing snow transport to sink areas amounted to an additional 16% of annual snowfall to shrub-tundra and an additional 182% to drifts. For the catchment, 19{\textperiodcentered}5% of annual snowfall sublimated from blowing snow, 5{\textperiodcentered}8% was transported into the catchment and 86{\textperiodcentered}5% accumulated on the ground. The model overestimated snow accumulation in the catchment by 6%. The application demonstrates that winter precipitation alone is insufficient to calculate snow accumulation and that blowing snow processes and landscape patterns govern the spatial distribution and total accumulation of snow water equivalent over the winter. These processes can be modelled by relatively simple algorithms, and, when distributed by landscape type over the catchment, produce reasonable estimates of snow accumulation and loss in wind-swept regions. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {NASA's 2017 SnowEx field campaign at Grand Mesa, CO, generated Airborne Laser Scans (ALS), Terrestrial Laser Scans (TLS), and snow-probe transects, which allowed for a comparison between snow depth measurement techniques. At six locations, comparisons between gridded ALS and TLS observations, at 1-m resolution, had a median snow depth difference of 5 cm, root-mean-square difference of 16 cm, mean-absolute difference of 10 cm, and 3-cm difference in standard deviation. ALS generally had greater but similar snow depth values to TLS, and results were not sensitive to the gridded cell size between 0.5 and 5 m. The greatest disagreements were where snow-off TLS scans had shrubs and high incidence angles, leading to deeper snow depths (>10 cm) from ALS than TLS. The low vegetation and oblique angles caused occlusion in the TLS data and thus produced higher snow-off bare Earth models relative to the ALS. Furthermore, in subcanopy areas where both ALS and TLS data existed, snow depth differences were comparable to differences in the open. Meanwhile, median values from 52 snow-probe transects and near-coincident ALS data had a mean difference of 6 cm, root-mean-square difference of 8 cm, mean-absolute difference of 7 cm, and a mean difference in the standard deviation of 1 cm. Snow depth probes had greater but similar snow depth values to ALS. Therefore, based on comparisons with TLS and snow depth probes, ALS captured snow depth magnitude with better than or equal agreement to what has been reported in previous studies and showed the ability to capture high-resolution spatial variability.},

abstract = {A global warming, primarily affecting wintertime conditions at high latitudes will influence the functioning of the boreal forest. The least known term of the winter water-balance equation is evaporation of snow intercepted in forest canopies. Several investigations stress the importance of snow-interception evaporation in coniferous forests and evaporation fractions of gross precipitation as large as 0.2-0.5 have been observed by investigators in Scotland, Canada, and Japan. Evaporation rates as high as 0.56 mm h(-1) are reported. The largest differences between the rain and snow interception evaporation processes are the differences in Storage. Snow storage (both mass and duration) is often an order of magnitude larger than that for rain. Snow interception changes the canopy albedo although some studies indicate the opposite. Process knowledge is limited because of measurement difficulties but it is known that canopy closure, aerodynamic resistance (r(a)), and vapour-pressure deficit are important factors. Existing formulations of r(a) as function of storage location and age cannot fully explain observed differences in evaporation rates. Operational hydrology and weather models, and GCMs describe snow interception in a very simplified way and might benefit from incorporation of more realistic schemes.},

Present deglaciation is increasing the number and size of proglacial lakes around the world. This study provides a synthesis of knowledge on proglacial lake character and behaviour and critically evaluates the importance of proglacial lakes from a geological perspective. We show how 'ice-marginal' or 'ice-contact' lakes and other distal proglacial lakes can be distinguished from each other by geomorphological, sedimentological, chemical and biological characteristics. The key controls on proglacial lake geomorphology and sedimentology are outlined and discussed. Proglacial lakes can exacerbate mountain glacier and ice sheet margin ablation via mechanical and thermal stresses, but very large lakes can moderate summer air temperatures and relatively retard summer ice ablation. Proglacial lakes interrupt meltwater flux and are very efficient sediment traps. Hydrological routing and consequent geomorphological activity can be radically modified by sudden drainage of proglacial lakes and resultant glacial lake outburst floods; exceptionally large proglacial lake drainages affected global ocean circulation and global climate during the Quaternary. Overall, analyses of proglacial lakes can provide a valuable insight into (i) patterns, character and behaviour of mountain glaciers, ice sheets and glaciations, and (ii) the impacts of past, present and future deglaciation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Lacustrine sediments are often used for paleoclimate reconstructions as continuous archives of several physical and biological proxies. The relation between autochthonous and allochthonous sedimentation in alpine lakes is a complex system that may cause difficulties when interpreting biological and physical parameters. Results from previous studies of alpine lakes in northern Sweden have demonstrated that non-glacial processes produce minerogenic lake deposits with similar physical characteristics (density, LOI, magnetic susceptibility, grain-size) as those that have been associated with glacier fluctuations in proglacial lakes. In this study of two consecutive proglacial alpine lakes we show that fluvial redeposition of alluvial fan deposits significantly affects the Holocene lake sedimentation. Depending on the geomorphological setting, such fluvial redeposition signals may actually overprint a glaciofluvial signal. We also show that minerogenic laminations of fluvial origin are impossible to separate from the type of laminations usually used to infer glacier activity using the most common lithological sediment parameters. This emphasizes the complexity of sediment transport system in proglacial (paraglacial) settings where redeposition of older glacial sediment is of major importance. Our results highlight the need for thorough understanding of the geomorphological setting before inferences are made about climate variations from sedimentation in alpine lakes. Both lakes in this study contain sediment sequences with both episodic (turbidites) and continuously deposited sediments. Unfortunately we have too few radiocarbon dates to exactly date the turbidites but it is clear that turbidite layers in any case should be excluded from age model constructions since episodic sedimentation significantly influences the sediment age–depth relationship. In our age-model turbidites cause a potential dating error of several hundred, up to a thousand, years.},

We discriminate seven types of varves on the basis of couplet thickness and internal structure, and compare them to annual hydrographs over the period of record. The seven varve types record summer snowmelt floods, autumn floods, mid-season floods, years with two major floods, years with three major floods, years with more than three major floods, and periods of sustained glacier runoff. Varves attributed to autumn storms and glacier runoff are dominant, exhibit serial dependence, and are most common during six periods: AD 1300-1320, 1380-1410, 1470-1500, 1710-1730, 1880-1906, and 1916-1945. In contrast, varves attributed to summer snowmelt floods are randomly distributed through time. Thickest varves occur during the decades AD 1090-1110, 1120-1170, 1210-1250, 1310-1330, 1390-1450, 1720-1780, 1860-1900, and 1920-1945. The relation between Little Ice Age glacier activity and lake sedimentation is complex, but the thickest varves coincide with times of rapid glacier retreat and periods when air temperatures were warmer than average. The results confirm the importance of sediment transfers during the summer and autumn runoff season in the British Columbia Coast Mountains. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Processes shaping forest snow cover evolution often vary at small spatial scales, which are not resolved by most model applications. Representing this variability at larger scales and coarser model resolutions constitutes a major challenge for model developers. In this study, we use a well-validated hyper-resolution forest snow model that explicitly resolves the spatial variability of canopy-snow interactions at the meter scale to explore adequate representation of forest-snow processes at coarser resolutions (50 m). For this purpose, we assess coarser-resolution runs against spatially averaged results from corresponding hyper-resolution simulations over a 150,000 m2 model domain. For the coarser-resolution simulations, we tested alternative upscaling strategies. Our results reveal considerable discrepancies between strategies that utilize generalized canopy metrics versus strategies that apply a more detailed set of process-specific canopy descriptors. Particularly, the inclusion of canopy descriptors that represent the various scales and perspectives relevant to the individual processes leads to accurate simulation of forest snow cover dynamics at coarse resolutions. Our results further demonstrate that a realistic representation of snow-covered fraction in snowmelt calculations is important even for relatively small (∼50 m) grid cells. Ultimately, this work provides recommendations for modeling forest-snow processes in large-scale applications, which allow coarse resolution simulations to approximate spatially averaged results of corresponding hyper-resolution simulations.},

abstract = {Observations of land surface and snowpack energetics and mass fluxes were made over arctic shrub tundra of varying canopy height and density using radiometers, eddy covariance flux measurements, and snow mass changes from snow surveys of depth and density. Over several years, snow accumulation in the shrubs was found to be consistently higher than in sparse tundra due to greater retention of snowfall by all shrubs and wind redistribution of snowfall to tall shrubs. Where snow accumulation was highest due to snow redistribution, shrubs often became buried by the end of winter. Three classes of shrub-snow interactions were observed: tall shrubs that were exposed over snow tall shrubs that were bent over and buried by snow, and short shrubs buried by snow. Tall shrubs buried by snow underwent 'spring-up' during melt. Though spring-up was episodic for a single shrub, over an area it was a progressive emergence from early to mid melt of vegetation that dramatically altered the radiative and aerodynamic properties of the surface. Short shrubs were exposed more rapidly once snow depth declined below shrub height, usually near the end of melt. Net radiation increased with increasing shrub due to the decreased reflectance of shortwave radiation overwhelming the increased longwave emission from relatively warm and dark shrubs. Net radiation to snow under shrubs was much smaller than that over shrubs, but was greater than that to snow with minimal shrub exposure, in this case the difference was due to downward longwave radiation from the canopy exceeding the effect of attenuated shortwave transmission through the canopy. Because of reduced turbulent transfer under shrub canopies and minimal water vapour contributions from the bare shrub branches, sublimation fluxes declined with increasing shrub exposure. In contrast, sensible heat fluxes to the shrub surface became more negative and those to the underlying snow surface more-positive with increasing shrub exposure, because of relatively warm shrub branches, particularly on clear days. From well-exposed tall shrubs, both a large upward sensible heat flow from shrub to atmosphere and a downward flow that contributed substantially to snowmelt were detected. As a result of radiative and turbulent transfer in shrub canopies, melt rates increased with shrub exposure. However, shrub exposure was not a simple function of shrub height or presence, and the transition to shrub-exposed landscape depended on initial snow depth, shrub height, shrub species and cumulative melt, and this in turn controlled the melt energetics for a particular site. As a result of these complex interactions, observations over several years showed that snowmelt rates were generally, but not always, enhanced under shrub canopies in comparison with sparsely vegetated tundra.

abstract = {Low-level cold air from eastern Washington often flows westward through mountain passes in the Washington Cascades, creating localized inversions and locally reducing climatological temperatures. The persistence of this inversion during a frontal passage can result in complex patterns of snow and rain that are difficult to predict. Yet these predictions are critical to support highway avalanche control, ski resort operations, and modeling of headwater snowpack storage. In this study we used observations of precipitation phase from a disdrometer and snow depth sensors across Snoqualmie Pass, WA, to evaluate surface-air-temperature-based and mesoscale-model-based predictions of precipitation phase during the anomalously warm 2014-2015 winter. Correlations of phase between surface-based methods and observations were greatly improved (r2 from 0.45 to 0.66) and frozen precipitation biases reduced (+36% to -6% of accumulated snow water equivalent) by using air temperature from a nearby higher-elevation station, which was less impacted by low-level inversions. Alternatively, we found a hybrid method that combines surface-based predictions with output from the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model to have improved skill (r2 = 0.61) over both parent models (r2 = 0.42 and 0.55). These results suggest that prediction of precipitation phase in mountain passes can be improved by incorporating observations or models from above the surface layer.},

abstract = {Paraglacial geomorphology is the study of earth-surface processes, sediments, landforms, landsystems and landscapes that are directly conditioned by former glaciation and deglaciation. The withdrawal of glacier ice exposes landscapes that are in an unstable or metastable state, and consequently liable to modification, erosion and sediment release at rates greatly exceeding background denudation rates. This paper (1) reviews research on paraglacial processes, landforms and landscape change in a range of geomorphological settings; (2) explores the importance of paraglacial landscape modification and sediment recycling as a component of alternating glacial/nonglacial landscape evolution; (3) assesses the nature and significance of paraglacial facies in Quaternary stratigraphic sequences; and (4) develops a general model of the sequence of paraglacial landscape modification and the changing nature of paraglacial landsystems. Six paraglacial landsystems are identified: rock slopes, drift-mantled slopes, glacier forelands, and alluvial, lacustrine and coastal systems. Each contains a wide range of paraglacial landforms and sediment facies. Collectively these landforms and sediments (e.g. talus accumulations, debris cones, alluvial fans, valley fills, deltas and coastal barrier structures) can be conceptualised as storage components of an interrupted sediment cascade with four primary sources (rockwalls, drift-mantled slopes, valley-floor glacigenic deposits and coastal glacigenic deposits) and four terminal sediment sinks (alluvial valley-fill deposits, lacustrine deposits, coastal/nearshore deposits and shelf/offshore deposits). Paraglacial sediment stores and sinks may form major sources of readily erodible sediment during the early stages of glacial cycles, leading to high rates of sediment transport during periods of glacier or ice-sheet expansion. Probably because of the limited preservation potential of paraglacial sediments that were subsequently over-run by glacier ice, identification of paraglacial facies in both terrestrial and marine settings has been almost exclusively limited to sequences that post-date the Last Glacial Maximum. The unifying concept of paraglacial geomorphology is that of glacially conditioned sediment availability. Relaxation of landscape elements to nonglacial conditions operates over timescales of 10 1–>10 4 years, and is conditioned by both process and spatial scale. Rate of sediment reworking can be described by an exhaustion model. In the case of primary reworking of glacigenic sediment, the rate of reworking declines approximately exponentially through time, though extrinsic perturbation may rejuvenate paraglacial sediment flux long after termination of the initial period of paraglacial adjustment. Landscape-scale (particularly alluvial and coastal) systems may exhibit intrinsically complex responses due to reworking of secondary paraglacial sediment stores. The long relaxation time of such systems implies that many areas deglaciated in the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene have still not fully adjusted (in terms of sediment supply) to nonglacial conditions.},

Interannual varve thickness correlates with annual flood magnitude. Interdecadal trends in varve thickness are influenced by other environmental factors such as glacier recession. Despite major differences in the lakes and their contributing watersheds, substantial concordance is observed among the records. A pronounced change in the nature of lake sedimentation, accompanied by higher interannual variability, occurred in 1980. The change coincides with an increase in the magnitude of autumn flooding and major re-organization of the North Pacific climate system.

abstract = {Numerous research basins have been instrumented and monitored for understanding the water balance and improving rainfall-runoff relationships in Canada, with mixed results and uneven improvements in our understanding and prediction of these systems. Two limitations on gaining useful results from these basins have been that their experimental designs often depended on long-term comparisons of observations and/or on calibrations of conceptual, rather than physically based, runoff models. Such comparisons and calibrations can be hampered by changes in climate and land use, measurement uncertainties, mixed sets of processes causing the basin runoff response, an over-emphasis on streamflow rather than comprehensive basin hydrology and energetics and the relatively short time period that most Canadian research basins have been operating. An alternative to such traditional study of basin dynamics and response has been implemented where the hydrology was poorly understood and long term observations were not available or desirable. The new approach has provided rapid improvements to our understanding and prediction of these systems and is suited to application in ungauged basins. The approach consists of: i) intensive observations of the most uncertain hydrological processes or pathways in an experimental basin that represents ungauged basins in some region; ii) development of algorithms to describe the operation of the primary hydrological processes and pathways in the experimental basin, and; 67 Prediction in Ungauged Basins: Approaches for Canada's Cold Regions},

abstract = {Airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) measurements carried out in the southern Sierra Nevada in 2010 in the snow-free and peak-snow-accumulation periods were analyzed for topographic and vegetation effects on snow accumulation. Point-cloud data were processed from four primarily mixed-conifer forest sites covering the main snow-accumulation zone, with a total surveyed area of over 106 km2. The percentage of pixels with at least one snow-depth measurement was observed to increase from 65-90 to 99 % as the sampling resolution of the lidar point cloud was increased from 1 to 5 m. However, a coarser resolution risks undersampling the under-canopy snow relative to snow in open areas and was estimated to result in at least a 10 cm overestimate of snow depth over the main snow-accumulation region between 2000 and 3000 m, where 28 % of the area had no measurements. Analysis of the 1 m gridded data showed consistent patterns across the four sites, dominated by orographic effects on precipitation. Elevation explained 43 % of snow-depth variability, with slope, aspect and canopy penetration fraction explaining another 14 % over the elevation range of 1500-3300 m. The relative importance of the four variables varied with elevation and canopy cover, but all were statistically significant over the area studied. The difference between mean snow depth in open versus under-canopy areas increased with elevation in the rain-snow transition zone (1500-1800 m) and was about 35 ± 10 cm above 1800 m. Lidar has the potential to transform estimation of snow depth across mountain basins, and including local canopy effects is both feasible and important for accurate assessments.},

abstract = {Pretreatment of sediment with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic constituents and aid deflocculation is a common component of particle size analyses of terrestrial and marine sediments. This study quantitatively determined the effect of a range of treatment levels on particle size distribution among four sediment types representing a range of mineral/organic particle size distributions, organic content and particle characterisation (charcoal or detrital plant material). The hypothesis was that complete removal of organic particles would lead to improved repeatability of results for a given sample and treatment level. Repeatability was assessed with a coefficient of variance calculation and a comparison of particle size distribution patterns within and across treatments. The effect of treatment levels on commonly used distribution descriptors (e.g. texture ratios and measures of central tendency) were then examined for each sample. Samples characterised primarily by detrital material responded most readily to treatment, whereas charcoal-dominated samples required higher levels of treatment to achieve increased repeatability and disappearance of large organic particles. Certain distribution descriptors, such as modal analysis, were found to be more resilient to organic particle presence, although amplitude of the organic distribution and the degree of overlap with the inorganic signal in some cases obscured even this metric. Thus, final treatment recommendations are based on sample characteristics and the types of distribution descriptors used in a study.},

abstract = {<p>Seasonal measurements of glacier mass balance provide insight into the relation between climate forcing and glacier change. To evaluate the feasibility of using remotely sensed methods to assess seasonal balance, we completed tandem airborne laser scanning (ALS) surveys and field-based glaciological measurements over a 4-year period for six alpine glaciers that lie in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains, near the headwaters of the Columbia River, British Columbia, Canada. We calculated annual geodetic balance using coregistered late summer digital elevation models (DEMs) and distributed estimates of density based on surface classification of ice, snow, and firn surfaces. Winter balance was derived using coregistered late summer and spring DEMs, as well as density measurements from regional snow survey observations and our glaciological measurements. Geodetic summer balance was calculated as the difference between winter and annual balance. Winter mass balance from our glaciological observations averaged <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">1.95±0.09</span>&thinsp;m&thinsp;w.e. (meter water equivalent), 4&thinsp;% larger than those derived from geodetic surveys. Average glaciological summer and annual balance were 3&thinsp;% smaller and 3&thinsp;% larger, respectively, than our geodetic estimates. We find that distributing snow, firn, and ice density based on surface classification has a greater influence on geodetic annual mass change than the density values themselves. Our results demonstrate that accurate assessments of seasonal mass change can be produced using ALS over a series of glaciers spanning several mountain ranges. Such agreement over multiple seasons, years, and glaciers demonstrates the ability of high-resolution geodetic methods to increase the number of glaciers where seasonal mass balance can be reliably estimated.</p>.},

abstract = {Modern sedimentary processes were studied in Kluane Lake, Yukon Territory, to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of sediment distribution in a large, dynamic, glacier-fed lake. Data from a river monitoring station, moored instruments, sediment traps, and water-column profiles in the lake were used to document lacustrine sedimentary processes in 2006 and 2007. During the peak melt season, the suspended sediment concentration of Slims River is weakly dependent on river discharge and can reach up to 5g L-1, although a diurnal range between 1 and 2g L-1 is more commonly observed. The high suspended sediment load in the river generates continuous, diurnally fluctuating turbidity currents in Kluane Lake with maximum velocities up to 0.6m s-1. During times of peak flow, variations in velocity can be traced to beyond 4km from the river mouth. The vertical concentration profiles, mass accumulation rates, and suspended sediment loads show distinctive longitudinal variations; the highest rate of accumulation occurs $\sim$1km from the point of inflow, which is concurrent with a distinct change in flow structure. Diurnal laminations are apparent in sediment traps close to the point of inflow and can be directly linked to variations in current velocity; however, these laminations do not occur consistently over space or time. These results suggest that long-term measurement records of lacustrine turbidity currents provide valuable insights regarding the multiple scales of environmental variability and have important implications for paleoenvironmental reconstruction using lacustrine sediments.Les processus modernes de s{\'{e}}dimentation ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} {\'{e}}tudi{\'{e}}s au lac Kluane, Territoire du Yukon, afin de d{\'{e}}terminer les patrons, dans le temps et l'espace, de la distribution de s{\'{e}}diments dans un grand lac dynamique, aliment{\'{e}} par des glaciers.

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) aims to identify the key parameters that affect model performance and it plays important roles in model parameterization, calibration, optimization, and uncertainty quantification. However, the increasing complexity of hydrological models means that a large number of parameters need to be estimated. To better understand how these complex models work, efficient SA methods should be applied before the application of hydrological modeling. This study provides a comprehensive review of global SA methods in the field of hydrological modeling. The common definitions of SA and the typical categories of SA methods are described. A wide variety of global SA methods have been introduced to provide a more efficient evaluation framework for hydrological modeling. We review, analyze, and categorize research into global SA methods and their applications, with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the hydrological modeling field. The advantages and disadvantages are also discussed and summarized. An application framework and the typical practical steps involved in SA for hydrological modeling are outlined. Further discussions cover several important and often overlooked topics, including the relationship between parameter identification, uncertainty analysis, and optimization in hydrological modeling, how to deal with correlated parameters, and time-varying SA. Finally, some conclusions and guidance recommendations on SA in hydrological modeling are provided, as well as a list of important future research directions that may facilitate more robust analyses when assessing hydrological modeling performance.},

abstract = {The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) is a globally complete collection of digital outlines of glaciers, excluding the ice sheets, developed to meet the needs of the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for estimates of past and future mass balance. The RGI was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the $\sim$198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999-2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800±34 000km2. The uncertainty, about ±5%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to sea-level rise.},

abstract = {Measurements were conducted in coniferous forests of differing density, insolation and latitude to test whether air temperatures are suitable surrogates for canopy temperature in estimating sub-canopy longwave irradiance to snow. Air temperature generally was a good representation of canopy radiative temperature under conditions of low insolation. However during high insolation, needle and branch temperatures were well estimated by air temperature only in relatively dense canopies and exceeded air temperatures elsewhere. Tree trunks exceeded air temperatures in all canopies during high insolation, with the relatively hottest trunks associated with direct interception of sunlight, sparse canopy cover and dead trees. The exitance of longwave radiation from these relatively warm canopies exceeded that calculated assuming canopy temperature was equal to air temperature. This enhancement was strongly related to the extinction of shortwave radiation by the canopy. Estimates of sub-canopy longwave irradiance using either two-energy source or two thermal regime approaches to evaluate the contribution of canopy longwave exitance performed better than did estimates that used only air temperature and sky view. However, there was little evidence that such corrections are necessary under cloudy or low solar insolation conditions. The longwave enhancement effect due to shortwave extinction was important to sub-canopy longwave irradiance to snow during clear, sunlit conditions. Longwave enhancement increased with increasing solar elevation angle and decreasing air temperature. Its relative importance to longwave irradiance to snow was insensitive to canopy density. As errors from ignoring enhanced longwave contributions from the canopy accumulate over the winter season, it is important for snow energy balance computations to include the enhancement in order to better calculate snow internal energy and therefore the timing and magnitude of snowmelt and sublimation.

abstract = {A realistic description of how temperatures vary with elevation is crucial for ecosystem studies and for models of basin‐scale snowmelt and spring streamflow. This paper explores surface temperature variability using temperature data from an array of 37 sensors, called the Yosemite network, which traverses both slopes of the Sierra Nevada in the vicinity of Yosemite National Park, California. These data indicate that a simple lapse rate is often a poor description of the spatial temperature structure. Rather, the spatial pattern of temperature over the Yosemite network varies considerably with synoptic conditions. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) were used to identify the dominant spatial temperature patterns and how they vary in time. Temporal variations of these surface temperature patterns were correlated with large‐scale weather conditions, as described by National Centers for Environmental Prediction‐National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis data. Regression equations were used to downscale larger‐scale weather parameters, such as Reanalysis winds and pressure, to the surface temperature structure over the Yosemite network. These relationships demonstrate that strong westerly winds are associated with relatively warmer temperatures on the east slope and cooler temperatures on the west slope of the Sierra, and weaker westerly winds are associated with the opposite pattern. Reanalysis data from 1948 to 2005 indicate weakening westerlies over this time period, a trend leading to relatively cooler temperatures on the east slope over decadal timescales. This trend also appears in long‐term observations and demonstrates the need to consider topographic effects when examining long‐term changes in mountain regions.},

abstract = {Forest clearings are common features of evergreen forests and produce snowpack accumulation and melt differing from that in adjacent forests and open terrain. This study has investigated the challenges in specifying the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat to snowpacks in forest clearings. The snowpack in two forest clearings in the Canadian Rockies was simulated using a one-dimensional (1D) snowpack model. A trade-off was found between optimizing against measured snow surface temperature or snowmelt when choosing how to specify the turbulent fluxes. Schemes using the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory tended to produce negatively biased surface temperature, while schemes that enhanced turbulent fluxes, to reduce the surface temperature bias, resulted in too much melt. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo experiments showed that no realistic parameter set could successfully remove biases in both surface temperature and melt. A simple scheme that excludes atmospheric stability correction was required to successfully simulate surface temperature under low wind speed conditions. Nonturbulent advective fluxes and/or nonlocal sources of turbulence are thought to account for the maintenance of heat exchange in low-wind conditions. The simulation of snowmelt was improved by allowing enhanced latent heat fluxes during low-wind conditions. Caution is warranted when snowpack models are optimized on surface temperature, as model tuning may compensate for deficiencies in conceptual and numerical models of radiative, conductive, and turbulent heat exchange at the snow surface and within the snowpack. Such model tuning could have large impacts on the melt rate and timing of the snow-free transition in simulations of forest clearings within hydrological and meteorological models.},

abstract = {A global compilation of glacier advances and retreats for the past two millennia grouped by 17 regions (excluding Antarctica) highlights the nature of glacier fluctuations during the late Holocene. The dataset includes 275 time series of glacier fluctuations based on historical, tree ring, lake sediment, radiocarbon and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide data. The most detailed and reliable series for individual glaciers and regional compilations are compared with summer temperature and, when available, winter precipitation reconstructions, the most important parameters for glacier mass balance. In many cases major glacier advances correlate with multi-decadal periods of decreased summer temperature. In a few cases, such as in Arctic Alaska and western Canada, some glacier advances occurred during relatively warm wet times. The timing and scale of glacier fluctuations over the past two millennia varies greatly from region to region. However, the number of glacier advances shows a clear pattern for the high, mid and low latitudes and, hence, points to common forcing factors acting at the global scale. Globally, during the first millennium CE glaciers were smaller than between the advances in 13th to early 20th centuries CE. The precise extent of glacier retreat in the first millennium is not well defined; however, the most conservative estimates indicate that during the 1st and 2nd centuries in some regions glaciers were smaller than at the end of 20th/early 21st centuries. Other periods of glacier retreat are identified regionally during the 5th and 8th centuries in the European Alps, in the 3rd–6th and 9th centuries in Norway, during the 10th–13th centuries in southern Alaska, and in the 18th century in Spitsbergen. However, no single period of common global glacier retreat of centennial duration, except for the past century, has yet been identified. In contrast, the view that the Little Ice Age was a period of global glacier expansion beginning in the 13th century (or earlier) and reaching a maximum in 17th–19th centuries is supported by our data. The pattern of glacier variations in the past two millennia corresponds with cooling in reconstructed temperature records at the continental and hemispheric scales. The number of glacier advances also broadly matches periods showing high volcanic activity and low solar irradiance over the past two millennia, although the resolution of most glacier chronologies is not enough for robust statistical correlations. Glacier retreat in the past 100–150 years corresponds to the anthropogenic global temperature increase. Many questions concerning the relative strength of forcing factors that drove glacier variations in the past 2 ka still remain.},

abstract = {Study of interception storage of snow by two species of sapling conifers in northern Idaho revealed that cumulative snow catch follows the classical law of autocatakinetic growth, or where Is, is interception storage, S is the interception storage capacity of the tree, e is the base of the natural logarithm, k is a constant expressing the rate of interception storage, P is accumulated snowfall, and P0 is accumulated snowfall at the time of most rapid storage (i.e., the point of inflection of the sigmoid curve). Interception storage conformed to the law in five storms in which snowfall began while the trees were bare, and in two storms in which snow fell while snow from previous storms persisted on the trees. Several small storms yielded insufficient data to define the appropriate constants, but inspection indicated no serious deviation from the general law.},

abstract = {Forest canopies exert significant controls over the spatial distribution of snow cover. Canopy snow interception efficiency is controlled by intrinsic processes (e.g., canopy structure), extrinsic processes (e.g., meteorological conditions), and the interaction of intrinsic-extrinsic factors (i.e., air temperature and branch stiffness). In hydrological models, intrinsic processes governing snow interception are typically represented by two-dimensional metrics like the leaf area index (LAI). To improve snow interception estimates and their scalability, new approaches are needed for better characterizing the three-dimensional distribution of canopy elements. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides a potential means of achieving this, with recent research focused on using ALS-derived metrics that describe forest spacing to predict interception storage. A wide range of canopy structural metrics that describe individual trees can also be extracted from ALS, although relatively little is known about which of them, and in what combination, best describes intrinsic canopy properties known to affect snow interception. The overarching goal of this study was to identify important ALS-derived canopy structural metrics that could help to further improve our ability to characterize intrinsic factors affecting snow interception. Specifically, we sought to determine how much variance in canopy intercepted snow volume can be explained by ALS-derived crown metrics, and what suite of existing and novel crown metrics most strongly affects canopy intercepted snow volume. To achieve this, we first used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to quantify snow interception on 14 trees. We then used these snow interception measurements to fit a random forest model with ALS-derived crown metrics as predictors. Next, we bootstrapped 1000 calculations of variable importance (percent increase in mean squared error when a given explanatory variable is removed), keeping nine canopy metrics for the final model that exceeded a variable importance threshold of 0.2. ALS-derived canopy metrics describing intrinsic tree structure explained approximately two-thirds of the snow interception variability (R2 ≥ 0.65, RMSE ≤ 0.52 m3, relative RMSE ≤ 48%) in our study when extrinsic factors were kept as constant as possible. For comparison, a generalized linear mixed-effects model predicting snow interception volume from LAI alone had a marginal R2 = 0.01. The three most important predictor variables were canopy length, whole-tree volume, and unobstructed returns (a novel metric). These results suggest that a suite of intrinsic variables may be used to map interception potential across larger areas and provide an improvement to interception estimates based on LAI.},

abstract = {The past century has seen significant research comparing snow accumulation and ablation in forested and open sites. In this review we compile and standardize the results of previous empirical studies to generate statistical relations between changes in forest cover and the associated changes in snow accumulation and ablation rate. The analysis drew upon 33 articles documenting these relationships at 65 individual sites in North America and Europe from the 1930s to present. Changes in forest cover explained 57% and 72% of the variance of relative changes in snow accumulation and ablation, respectively. The incorporation of geographic and average historic climatic information did not significantly improve the ability to predict changes in snow processes, mainly because most of the studies did not provide enough information on site characteristics such as slope and aspect or meteorological conditions taking place during the experiments. Two simple linear models using forest cover as the sole predictor of changes in snow accumulation and ablation are provided, as well as a review of the main sources of variation that prevent the elaboration of more accurate multiple regression models. Further studies should provide detailed information regarding the main sources of variation influencing snow processes including the effect of year-to-year changes in weather variables during the monitoring period. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Following a development similar to that used by Penman (1948) a general combination equation is derived to describe evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces. To account for departure from saturated conditions, the equation makes use of the concept of relative evaporation, the ratio of the actual to the potential evaporation, defined here as the evaporation rate which would occur under the existing atmospheric conditions if the surface were saturated at the actual surface temperature. A relationship is established between the relative evaporation and a dimensionless parameter called the relative drying power, the ratio of the drying power to the sum of the drying power and the net available energy (net radiation plus soil heat flux). The relationship is nondimensional and appears to be single-valued. The combination of this relationship with the general evaporation equation derived constitutes a simple model for obtaining estimates of evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces; no prior estimate of the potential evaporation is required, and the surface conditions of temperature and humidity need not be known. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {The results of a field study of the small-scale spatial structure of the depth of shallow seasonal snowcovers in prairie and arctic environments are presented. It is shown that the spatial distribution of snow depth is fractal at small scales, becoming random at scales beyond some limiting length. This is due to the autocorrelation of depth at small sampling distances. The transition of fractal to random behaviour is indexed by a 'cutoff length', which is defined by the intersection of the 'fractal' slope and horizontal tangent of a logarithmic plot of the standard deviation of depth versus sampling distance. The magnitude of the cutoff length is related to the degree of macroscopic variability of the underlying topography. An increase in length due to the effects of macroscopic topographic variability on snowcover accumulation is confirmed by de-trending field measurements. The de-trended data shown a cutoff length for wheat stubble and fallow surfaces of approximately 30 m, which is consistent with the distance determined from measurements on 'flat' fields. The implications of the transition of snow depth from fractal to random structure on the scales of snow sampling and modelling are presented. The cutoff length may provide a statistic for stratifying shallow snowcovers, by linking snow-cover properties to the underlying topography.},

abstract = {The breakup of snow cover into patches during snowmelt leads to a dynamic, heterogeneous land surface composed of melting snow, and wet and dry soil and plant surfaces. Energy exchange with the atmosphere is therefore complicated by horizontal gradients in surface temperature and humidity as snow surface temperature and humidity are regulated by the phase change of melting snow unlike snow-free areas. Airflow across these surface transitions results in local-scale advection of energy that has been documented as sensible heat during snowmelt, while latent heat advection has received scant attention. Herein, results are presented from an experiment measuring near-surface profiles of air temperature and humidity across snow-free to snow-covered transitions that demonstrates that latent heat advection can be the same order of magnitude as sensible heat advection and is therefore an important source of snowmelt energy. Latent heat advection is conditional on an upwind source of water vapor from a wetted snow-free surface.},

abstract = {This paper presents the issues in snow water equivalent (SWE) determination using acoustic reflectometry. To determine SWE, the density and the depth of each layer of snow in a snow pack need to be estimated. A noninvasive acoustic reflectometry technique to estimate the SWE is proposed in the mentioned paper, in which it is shown that SWE of the snowpacks with approximately 100 cm depth can be determined using a maximum length sequence (MLS) of length 7 as a probe signal. We performed similar experiments as reported in the mentioned paper to determine SWE using acoustic reflectometry but failed to replicate the given method. The signal processing-related issues such as design of probe signal, direct pickup problem, and so on of the mentioned paper are investigated and presented in this communication. We show that it is not possible to extract the reflection response by using the MLS of length 7 as a probe signal. The amount of sound attenuation and absorption in the snow medium is very high, of the order of 1 dB/cm and greater depending on the frequency, as reported in the literature and measured by us. Hence, the depth of snowpack investigated in the mentioned paper is practically difficult to achieve using conventional loudspeaker and microphone. Also, it has been explained how the cross-correlation peak width and, hence, the layer resolution achieved by the authors of the mentioned paper is not practically feasible by their reported method. We have also demonstrated that Wiener spiking deconvolution-based technique is not able to obtain the sharp peaks as shown in the mentioned paper.},

abstract = {Snow depth variability between different sides of the forest edge was analyzed using airborne lidar in the Olympic Mountains, WA; Tuolumne River Watershed, CA; Jemez Caldera, NM; and the Boulder Creek Watershed, CO. At Boulder Creek there were statistically significant snow depth differences between leeward and windward forest edges (mean: 38%), which were likely the result of cold winter temperatures (−5 to −10°C), substantial wind speeds (>10–12 m/s), and the forest architecture. In the Olympic Mountains, wind speeds were similar to Boulder Creek, but snow depth differences between forest edges were not significantly different, likely due to winter temperatures near 0°C and a more continuous forest distribution. At Jemez, forest shading likely caused significant snow depth differences between north and south facing forest edges (mean: 32%). Tuolumne had similar incoming solar radiation to Jemez, but only two of the four sites contained significant snow depth differences between north and south facing forest edges (14% and 31%). The Tuolumne sites without significant edge differences received less direct solar radiation due to shading by surrounding topography. At Jemez, Boulder Creek, and Tuolumne, snow depth differences between forest edges were greater than or equal to differences between exposed and under canopy areas. Furthermore, at Jemez and Tuolumne, forest-edge snow depth differences were similar to snow depth differences between different aspects in exposed areas. Therefore, snow depth differences between forest-edge classifications are of similar magnitude to classifications currently used to represent subelement heterogeneity within hydrologic models. Therefore, representation of forest-edge variability within models should be explored.},

abstract = {It is well known that one of the major problems in the application of land surface models is the determination of the various model parameters. In most cases, only one or a limited number of variables are used to estimate these parameters. This study evaluates the use of two fundamentally different global optimization methods, multistart weight-adaptive recursive parameter estimation (MWARPE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), for the estimation of hydrologic model parameters on the basis of data for multiple variables. MWARPE iteratively uses the linear recursive filter equations in a Monte Carlo setting and therefore does not rely on the explicit minimization of an objective function. However, a major drawback of the MWARPE method is the high dimensionality, determined by the number of observations, of the matrix to be inverted. On the other hand, PSO is a stochastic optimization method based on the collective strength of a population of individuals with flocking or herding behavior, as observed in a wide number of biological systems. In situ observations of net radiation; latent, sensible, and ground heat fluxes; and the soil moisture profile are used to determine the parameters of a simplified water and energy balance model. Both optimization methods are analyzed in terms of model performance and computational efficiency. Comparable results, expressed in terms of the root mean square error values, were obtained for both methods. However, it was found that MWARPE tends to slightly overfit the data.

abstract = {The continental divide along the spine of the Canadian Rockies in southwestern Canada is a critical headwater region for hydrological drainages to the Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic oceans. Major flooding events are typically attributed to heavy precipitation on its eastern side due to upslope (easterly) flows. Precipitation can also occur on the western side of the divide when moisture originating from the Pacific Ocean encounters the west-facing slopes of the Canadian Rockies. Often, storms propagating across the divide result in significant precipitation on both sides. Meteorological data over this critical region are sparse, with few stations located at high elevations. Given the importance of all these types of events, the Storms and Precipitation Across the continental Divide Experiment (SPADE) was initiated to enhance our knowledge of the atmospheric processes leading to storms and precipitation on either side of the continental divide. This was accomplished by installing specialized meteorological instrumentation on both sides of the continental divide and carrying out manual observations during an intensive field campaign from 24 April-26 June 2019. On the eastern side, there were two field sites: (i) at Fortress Mountain Powerline (2076 m a.s.l.) and (ii) at Fortress Junction Service, located in a high-elevation valley (1580 m a.s.l.). On the western side, Nipika Mountain Resort, also located in a valley (1087 m a.s.l.), was chosen as a field site. Various meteorological instruments were deployed including two Doppler light detection and ranging instruments (lidars), three vertically pointing micro rain radars, and three optical disdrometers. The three main sites were nearly identically instrumented, and observers were on site at Fortress Mountain Powerline and Nipika Mountain Resort during precipitation events to take manual observations of precipitation type and microphotographs of solid particles. The objective of the field campaign was to gather high-Temporal-frequency meteorological data and to compare the different conditions on either side of the divide to study the precipitation processes that can lead to catastrophic flooding in the region. Details on field sites, instrumentation used, and collection methods are discussed. Data from the study are publicly accessible from the Federated Research Data Repository at <a hrefCombining double low (Th{\'{e}}riault et al., 2020). This dataset will be used to study atmospheric conditions associated with precipitation events documented simultaneously on either side of a continental divide.

A time–distance curve constructed along a flowline extending south from southwestern British Columbia to the central Puget Lowland implies an average glacier advance rate of ca. 135 m/yr. The glacier terminus reached its southernmost limit ca. 16,950 yr ago and likely remained there for ca. 100 yr. In the vicinity of Seattle, where the glacier reached a maximum thickness of 1000 m, ice covered the landscape for ca. 1020 yr. Postglacial dates constraining the timing of ice retreat in the central lowland are as old as 16,420 cal yr B.P. and show that the terminus had retreated to the northern limit of the lowland within three to four centuries after the glacial maximum. The average rate of retreat was about twice the rate of advance and was enhanced by rapid calving recession along flowline sectors where the glacier front crossed deep proglacial lakes.},

abstract = {Arctic spring landscapes are usually characterized by a mosaic of coexisting snow-covered and bare ground patches. This phenomenon has major implications for hydrological processes, including meltwater production and runoff. Furthermore, as indicated by aircraft observations, it affects land-surface-atmosphere exchanges, leading to a high degree of variability in surface energy terms during melt. The heterogeneity and related differences when certain parts of the landscape become snow free also affects the length of the growing season and the carbon cycle. Small-scale variability in arctic snowmelt is addressed here by combining a spatially distributed end-of-winter snow cover with simulations of variable snowmelt energy balance factors for the small arctic catchment of Trail Valley Creek (63 km2). Throughout the winter, snow in arctic tundra basins is redistributed by frequent blowing snow events. Areas of above- or below-average end-of-winter snow water equivalents were determined from land-cover classifications, topography, land-cover-based snow surveys, and distributed surface wind-field simulations. Topographic influences on major snowmelt energy balance factors (solar radiation and turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat) were modelled on a small-scale (40 m) basis. A spatially variable complete snowmelt energy balance was subsequently computed and applied to the distributed snow cover, allowing the simulation of the progress of melt throughout the basin. The emerging patterns compared very well visually to snow cover observations from satellite images and aerial photographs. Results show the relative importance of variable end-of-winter snow cover, spatially distributed melt energy fluxes, and local advection processes for the development of a patchy snow cover. This illustrates that the consideration of these processes is crucial for an accurate determination of snow-covered areas, as well as the location, timing, and amount of meltwater release from arctic catchments, and should, therefore, be included in hydrological models. Furthermore, the study shows the need for a subgrid parameterization of these factors in the land surface schemes of larger scale climate models.

abstract = {Carbon dioxide, latent and sensible heat fluxes were measured by means of the eddy covariance method above a mountain meadow situated on a steep slope in the Stubai Valley in Austria, based on the hypothesis that, due to the low canopy height, measurements can be made in the shallow equilibrium layer where the wind field exhibits characteristics akin to level terrain. In order to test the validity of this hypothesis and to identify effects of complex terrain in the turbulence measurements, data were subjected to a rigorous testing procedure using a series of quality control measures established for surface-layer flows. The resulting high quality dataset comprised 36% of the original observations, the substantial reduction being mainly due to a change in surface roughness and associated fetch limitations in the wind sector dominating during nighttime and transition periods. The validity of the high quality dataset was further assessed by two independent tests: (i) a comparison with the net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange measured by means of ecosystem chambers, and (ii) the ability of the eddy covariance measurements to close the energy balance. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange measured by the eddy covariance method agreed reasonably well with ecosystem chamber measurements. The assessment of the energy balance closure showed that there was no significant difference in the correspondence between the meadow on the slope and another one situated on flat ground at the bottom of the Stubai Valley, available energy being underestimated by 28% and 29%, respectively. We thus conclude that, appropriate quality control provided, the eddy covariance measurements made above a mountain meadow on a steep slope are of similar quality as compared to flat terrain.},

We observed considerable uncertainty in DHSVM simulations of forest road and stream runoff. The accuracy of simulations decreased as the size of the area modeled decreased. For streamflow, 44% of attempted model structures exceeded a 0.5 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency threshold for a 630 ha catchment; 12% of attempted model structures exceeded a 0.5 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency threshold for a 55 ha catchment. DHSVM simulations produced behavioral model structures for only six of the 11 road ditchflow sites (<10 ha). Cumulative distribution functions of parameter values did not indicate specific parameter ranges of parameter values across all locations, indicating that parameter values in DHSVM are influenced by their interaction with other parameters. The sensitivity of parameters and the range of that sensitivity varied across simulations of road ditchflow and streamflow. DHSVM simulations for two streamflow locations varied outside the uncertainty bounds for 10%-22% of storm volumes and 12%-22% of peak flows, respectively. Twenty-eight percent to 52% of storm volumes and 28%-48% of peak flows were outside the uncertainty bounds for the six road ditchflow locations.},

abstract = {Forests modify snow accumulation and ablation rates as well as overall snow storage amounts and durations, with multiple processes acting simultaneously and often in different directions. To synthesize complex forest–snow relations and help guide near-term management decisions, we present a decision tree. The framework is based on a hypothesized hierarchy of processes and associated variables that predict forest effects on snow storage. In locations with high wind speeds, forests enhance snow storage magnitude and duration relative to open areas. Where wind speeds are low, and winter and spring air temperatures are colder, forests diminish snow storage magnitude but enhance duration. Where air temperatures are warmer, forests diminish both snow magnitude and duration. Forest structure and aspect are secondary influences. We apply the decision tree framework to map the influence of forests on snow storage under historic climate conditions across the western United States, but this decision tree is applicable in any region with forests and snow. This framework provides practitioners a first-step evaluation to guide management decisions that consider where and how forests can be managed to optimize in situ water storage alongside other objectives, such as reducing wildfire hazard. This framework also articulates geospatial hypotheses, in order of anticipated importance, to be tested in future investigations of forest–snow–climate relations.},

While moraines can provide snapshots of glacier extent, high-resolution records of environmental response to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, Younger Dryas cooling, and subsequent warming into the stable Holocene are rare. We describe the transition from the late Pleistocene to the Holocene using a $\sim$. 17,000-yr sediment record from Swiftcurrent Lake in eastern Glacier National Park, MT, with a focus on the period from $\sim$. 17 to 11. ka. Total organic and inorganic carbon, grain size, and carbon/nitrogen data provide evidence for glacial retreat from the late Pleistocene into the Holocene, with the exception of a well-constrained advance during the Younger Dryas from 12.75 to 11.5. ka. Increased detrital carbonate concentration in Swiftcurrent Lake sediment reflects enhanced glacial erosion and sediment transport, likely a result of a more proximal ice terminus position and a reduction in the number of alpine lakes acting as sediment sinks in the valley.},

abstract = {The June 2013 flood in the Canadian Rockies featured rain-on-snow (ROS) runoff generation at alpine elevations that contributed to the high streamflows observed during the event. Such a mid-summer ROS event has not been diagnosed in detail, and a diagnosis may help to understand future high discharge-producing hydrometeorological events in mountainous cold regions. The alpine hydrology of the flood was simulated using a physically based model created with the modular cold regions hydrological modelling platform. The event was distinctive in that, although at first, relatively warm rain fell onto existing snowdrifts inducing ROS melt; the rainfall turned to snowfall as the air mass cooled and so increased snowcover and snowpacks in alpine regions, which then melted rapidly from ground heat fluxes in the latter part of the event. Melt rates of existing snowpacks were substantially lower during the ROS than during the relatively sunny periods preceding and following the event as a result of low wind speeds, cloud cover and cool temperatures. However, at the basin scale, melt volumes increased during the event as a result of increased snowcover from the fresh snowfall and consequent large ground heat contributions to melt energy, causing snowmelt to enhance rainfall–runoff by one fifth. Flow pathways also shifted during the event from relatively slow sub-surface flow prior to the flood to an even contribution from sub-surface and fast overland flow during and immediately after the event. This early summer, high precipitation ROS event was distinctive for the impact of decreased solar irradiance in suppressing melt rates, the contribution of ground heat flux to basin scale snowmelt after precipitation turned to snowfall, the transition from slow sub-surface to fast overland flow runoff as the sub-surface storage saturated and streamflow volumes that exceeded precipitation. These distinctions show that summer, mountain ROS events should be considered quite distinct from winter ROS and can be important contributors to catastrophic events.

abstract = {Seasonal snow cover provides a thermally stable and humid refuge for overwintering plants in temperate forests. Canopy composition changes snow processes and shapes the thermal regime. To explore canopy effects on snow depth (SD) and below-the-snow temperature, ultrasonic sensors and time-lapse infrared cameras were used to monitor SD over two winters. Three forest types with different canopy compositions [the ratio of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.) basal area, RKp] on adret (sunny) and ubac (shady) slopes, including broadleaved secondary forests, Korean pine-broadleaved mixed forests, and Korean pine plantations, were selected as sample sites. Results showed time-lapse cameras were more accurate for monitoring SD in studied forests. Increasing RKp increased the snow interception rate and reduced the peak SD, snow melting rate, and snow cover duration. 21–69% of the snowfall was intercepted by the forests, with the RKp explaining 89% of the variance in interception rates. All forest stands had the lowest interception rate for severe snow events. For each forest type, plots on ubac slopes had a lower interception rate and thicker snow cover due to the positive effects of prevailing northerly wind on snow accumulation. Inter-annual variation of snowfall affected SD, snow melting rate, and below-the-snow temperature, with smaller differences among forest stands during the below-normal snow winter (2018/2019). The subnivium established in all plots during the normal snow winter (2019/2020) with the longest maintenance in secondary forest on ubac slopes and the shortest maintenance in Korean pine forests. The temperature increment under snowpack was positively correlated with SD while negatively correlated with air temperature. Overall, the forest with fewer evergreen canopy compositions was covered with thicker snowpack for a longer duration and had a more stable and warmer temperature regime, and fewer freeze-thaw events beneath the snow, which were essential for safe overwintering of regenerated individuals.},

abstract = {Significant differences in snow deposition, development of the seasonal snow cover, and the timing of melt can occur over small spatial distances because of differences in topographically controlled wind exposure and canopy cover. To capture important intrabasin hydrological processes related to heterogeneous snow cover and energy inputs, models must explicitly account for these differences. The “SNOBAL” point snow cover energy and mass balance model is used to evaluate differences in snow cover energy and mass balance at two sites in a small headwater drainage of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in the Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho. Though these sites are separated by only 350 m, they are located in distinctly different snow cover regimes. The “ridge” site (elevation 2097 m) is located on a broad shelf on the southern ridge of RCEW, and the “grove” site (elevation 2061 m) is sheltered by topography and forest canopy in a grove of aspen and fir trees just in the lee of the ridge on which the ridge site is located. Precipitation and climate data from these sites were used to drive SNOBAL for three water years: the 1984 water year, the largest discharge year on record; the 1992 water year, the smallest discharge year on record; and the very windy 1999 water year. Simulated energy balance during meltout at the ridge site was dominated by sensible heat flux; at the grove site the primary energy input during meltout was net allwave radiation. Comparison of total annual snowmelt with measured stream discharge from this headwater drainage showed that neither site adequately represented the basin input of water in any of the model years. This analysis details the disparity in energy and mass fluxes during the snow accumulation and ablation cycle between two proximal sites, illustrating the importance of understanding and spatially accounting for variable energy inputs and snow deposition patterns.},

abstract = {Making meaningful projections of the impacts that possible future climates would have on water resources in mountain regions requires understanding how cryosphere hydrology model performance changes under altered climate conditions and when the model is applied to ungaged catchments. Further, if we are to develop better models, we must understand which specific process representations limit model performance. This article presents a modeling tool, named the Conceptual Cryosphere Hydrology Framework (CCHF), that enables implementing and evaluating a wide range of cryosphere modeling hypotheses. The CCHF represents cryosphere hydrology systems using a set of coupled process modules that allows easily interchanging individual module representations and includes analysis tools to evaluate model outputs. CCHF version 1 (Mosier, 2016) implements model formulations that require only precipitation and temperature as climate inputs - for example variations on simple degree-index (SDI) or enhanced temperature index (ETI) formulations - because these model structures are often applied in data-sparse mountain regions, and perform relatively well over short periods, but their calibration is known to change based on climate and geography. Using CCHF, we implement seven existing and novel models, including one existing SDI model, two existing ETI models, and four novel models that utilize a combination of existing and novel module representations. The novel module representations include a heat transfer formulation with net longwave radiation and a snowpack internal energy formulation that uses an approximation of the cold content. We assess the models for the Gulkana and Wolverine glaciated watersheds in Alaska, which have markedly different climates and contain long-term US Geological Survey benchmark glaciers. Overall we find that the best performing models are those that are more physically consistent and representative, but no single model performs best for all of our model evaluation criteria.},

Proxy records of maximum June-August temperature, August precipitation and February snowpack provide insight into long-term seasonal climate changes. The intervals 1790-1810, 1850-1870 and 1930-1950 were characterized by warm summer temperatures.

February snowpacks have generally decreased in depth since 1873. The reconstructed winter, summer and net mass balance records indicate that glacier cover in the Columbia Mountains has varied primarily in response to decreased snowfall since the mid 1700s.

abstract = {A model including slope effects on snow redistribution, interception and energetics was developed using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model platform, parameterized with minimal calibration and manipulated to simulate the impacts of forest disturbance on mountain hydrology. A total of 40 forest disturbance scenarios were compared with the current land cover for four simulation years. Disturbance scenarios ranged from the impact of pine beetle kill of lodgepole pine to clear-cutting of north- or south-facing slopes, forest fire and salvage logging. Pine beetle impacts were small in all cases with increases in snowmelt volume of less than 10% and streamflow volume of less than 2%. This small impact is attributed to the low and relatively dry elevations of lodgepole pine forests in the basin. Forest disturbances due to fire and clear-cutting affected much larger areas and higher elevations of the basin and were generally more than twice as effective as pine beetle in increasing snowmelt or streamflow. For complete forest cover removal by burning and salvage logging, a 45% increase in snowmelt volume was simulated; however, this only translated into a 5% increase in spring and summer streamflow volume. Forest burning with the retention of standing burned trunks was the most effective forest cover treatment for increasing streamflow (up to 8%) because of its minimizing of winter snow sublimation losses from interception and blowing snow. However, increases in streamflow volumes were almost entirely due to reductions in intercepted snow sublimation with decreasing canopy coverage. Peak daily streamflow discharges responded more strongly to forest cover disturbance than did seasonal streamflow volumes, with increases of almost 25% in peak streamflow from the removal of forest canopy by fire and the retention of standing burned trunks. Peak flow was most effectively increased by forest removal on south-facing slopes and level sites. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Snow ablation and snow cover depletion beneath a forest canopy were investigated at the fine to stand scale, first by theoretical considerations and modelling and secondly using fine-scale measurements of changes to snow water equivalent (SWE) as an indicator of melt energy and of ablation. Three primary differences between observed areal snow ablation and snow cover depletion and calculatioins that presume uniform snow and energy were investigated: 1) spatial variation in initial snow mass 2) spatial variation in melt energy 3) spatial covariance between melt energy and initial snow mass A theoretical analysis showed that the results of any of the effects could result in areal ablation rates being smaller than available melt energy and contribute effects that cause snow cover depletion curves similar to those that are frequently observed. Field data from a dense boreal spruce stand in the Yukon Territory showed that the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent was lognormally distributed and independent of the energy available for melt, which was normally distributed. Through the spatial variation in melt energy was significant in this forest, ablation calculations that used a synthetic distribution of snow water equivalent and presumed uniform melt energy were sufficient to describe snow cover depletion rates and snow ablation.},

Since the late 1800s, however, glaciers have thinned and retreated, mainly because of atmospheric warming. Glacier retreat in western Canada and other regions is exposing subfossil tree stumps, soils and plant detritus that, until recently, were beneath tens to hundreds of metres of ice. In addition, human artefacts and caribou dung are emerging from permanent snow patches many thousands of years after they were entombed. Dating of these materials indicates that many of these glaciers and snow patches are smaller today than at any time in the past several thousand years. This evidence, in turn, suggests that glacier recession in the 20th century is unprecedented during the past several millennia and that glaciers in western Canada have reached minimum extents only 150-300 years after they achieved their maximum Holocene extents.},

abstract = {The Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) was modified to correct an underestimation of the winter albedo in evergreen needleleaf forests. Default values for the visible and near-infrared albedo of a canopy with intercepted snow, $\alpha$VIS,cs and $\alpha$NIR,cs, respectively, were too small, and the fraction of the canopy covered with snow, fsnow, increased too slowly with interception, producing a damped albedo response. A new model for fsnow is based on zI*, the effective depth of newly intercepted snow required to increase the canopy albedo to its maximum, which corresponds in the model with fsnow=1. Snow unloading rates were extracted from visual assessments of photographs and modelled based on relationships with meteorological variables, replacing the time-based method employed in CLASS. These parameterizations were tested in CLASS version 3.6 at boreal black spruce and jack pine forests in Saskatchewan, Canada, a subalpine Norway spruce and silver fir forest at Alptal, Switzerland, and a boreal maritime forest at Hitsujigaoka, Japan. Model configurations were assessed based on the index of agreement, d, relating simulated and observed daily albedo. The new model employs $\alpha$VIS,cs=0.27, $\alpha$NIR,cs=0.38 and zI*=3cm. The best single-variable snow unloading algorithm, determined by the average cross-site d, was based on wind speed. Two model configurations employing ensemble averages of the unloading rate as a function of total incoming radiation and wind speed, and air temperature and wind speed, respectively, produced larger minimum cross-site d values but a smaller average. The default configuration of CLASS 3.6 produced a cross-site average d from October to April of 0.58. The best model employing a single parameter (wind speed at the canopy top) for modelling the unloading rate produced an average d of 0.86, while the two-parameter ensemble-average unloading models produced a minimum d of 0.81 and an average d of 0.84.},

Our results indicate that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (900-1300 AD) the Pacific Northwest experienced exceptional wetness in winter and that during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1450-1850 AD) conditions were drier, contrasting with hydroclimatic anomalies in the desert Southwest and consistent with climate dynamics related to the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). These findings are somewhat discordant with drought records from tree rings, suggesting that differences in seasonal sensitivity between the two proxies allow a more compete understanding of the climate system and likely explain disparities in inferred climate trends over centennial timescales.},

abstract = {Reconstruction of the geomorphic history of the Moose Lake delta is used to infer environmental change in the uppermost Fraser River watershed, British Columbia. Delta-top changes are interpreted from surface channel morphology, riverbank exposures, hand auger data, vibracores and other borehole records. River channel and overbank sediments are related to source area contributions in terms of granule lithology and fine (< 63 Am) fraction geochemistry. A substantial area of the northeast delta-top floodplain dates from the early Holocene, and is characterized by fragmentary, low-discharge paleochannels with bed material characteristic of the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Floodplain development since ca. 4.0 ka BP has been limited to the western and southern areas of the delta and records persistently higher sediment loads, aggradation and larger, more active channels. These changes reflect overall shifts from warm, dry Hypsithermal to cooler, wetter Neoglacial climatic conditions defined regionally. The composition of both laterally and vertically accreted floodplain sediments plus channel morphology and floodplain stratigraphy record the changing influence of partially glaciated source areas on the Holocene sediment flux. Specifically, periods of climatic deterioration and possibly glacier expansion lead to relatively greater yields of carbonate-rich sediment from the higher elevation Moose River sub-basin. Storage and reworking of sediments on the Moose Lake delta-top floodplain influence interpretation of the more distal lacustrine record. Over the last 4000 years, gradual increases in lacustrine sedimentation rate of up to f 18% are inferred to result from delta progradation.},

The system is an updated and more sophisticated version of previous acoustic sensing systems, and this paper presents an update on the development of acoustic sensing methods to measure multiple snowpack properties and obtain images of snowpack stratigraphy. Air-coupled acoustic waves were sent into and reflected from the snowpack by the SAS2 system. An inverse model based on a modified version of the Biot-Stoll theory of sound propagation through porous media was used to obtain acoustic measurements of snow and images of the snowpack. The SAS2 was deployed at ten field sites in the Canadian Rockies. Stationary and portable versions of the system were deployed and tested. This paper reports initial tests of the SAS2 that were conducted at the field sites to compare acoustic model outputs with gravimetric measurements of snow density, dielectric measurements of liquid water content, and thermocouple and thermometer measurements of snow temperature. Snow water equivalent could be estimated more accurately and quickly with the SAS2 than with an ESC30 gravimetric snow tube. Unlike monopulse sonar and radar sensors, the SAS2 utilizes a continuous-wave Maximum Length Sequence (MLS) that is more robust to environmental noise. The SAS2 serves as a proof-of-concept of the acoustic snow measurement technique with potential for further research as identified and discussed in this paper.},

When coupled to an atmospheric model in a GCM, however, drying and warming of the air because of the reduced sublimation provides a feedback that limits the impact of the new canopy snow model on the predicted sublimation. There is little impact on the average annual snowmelt runoff in the GCM, but runoff is delayed and peak runoff increased by the introduction of the canopy snow model.},

As our understanding of the hydrologrcal and climatological cycles has improved, and our ability to manipulate the hydrologic cycle has increased, so too have the challenges associated with managing a limited natural resource for a growing pop ulation. Modern civilization has made remarkable progress in water management in the past few centuries. Burgeoning cities now survive in desert regions, relying on a mix of simple and complex technologies and management systems to bring adequate water and remove wastewater. These systems have permitted agricultural and urban concentrations production to expand in regions previously thought to have inadequate moisture. However, evidence is also mounting that our current management and use of water is unsustainable. Physical, economic, and ecological limits constrain the development of new supplies and additional water withdrawals, even in regions not pre viously thought vulnerable to water constraints. New kinds of limits are forcing water managers and policy makers to rethink previous assumptions about population, regional planning, and forms of development. In addition, new threats, especially the chal technology, lenges posed by climatic changes, are now apparent. in arid and semiarid Sustainably managing and using water regions such as the southwestern United States will require new thinking about water in an interdisciplinary and integrated way.

A locally homogeneous site surrounded by forested mountainous terrain was instrumented allowing 5-level profile measurements of wind speed, temperature, and water vapour, as well as two levels of eddy covariance measurement. Mean profiles exhibit logarithmic distribution with height up to 2.5 m height. The momentum roughness length values, z 0m derived from the eddy covariance measurements were at least an order of magnitude larger than typical values over snow, indicating that the air flow was much more turbulent than would be expected from shear stress developed at the snow surface. Accordingly, the measured wind profile did not match to the expected wind profile using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and first-order closure methods. Despite this discordance, the increased turbulence appears to be well matched to the temperature and water vapour profiles, confirming the measured latent and sensible heat fluxes. Gravimetric evaporation measurements provided further agreement with the latent heat flux measured by the eddy covariance technique. The failure of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory at this site suggests that the application of flux estimation techniques that are based on flux-profile relationships would predict smaller heat flux values than those that were measured.},

A physically based distributed model of snowmelt runoff generation developed for the Upper Kolyma River basin (the catchment area is about 100 000 km2) has been used to estimate the sensitivity of snowmelt dynamics over the basin and flood hydrographs to the parameterization of subgrid effects based on the hypothesis of statistical self-similarity of the maximum snow water equivalent fields. Such parameterization of subgrid effects enables us to improve the description of snowmelt dynamics both within subgrid areas and over the entire river basin. The snowmelt flood hydrographs appear less sensitive to the self-similarity of snow cover over subgrid areas than to the dynamics of snowmelt because of a too large catchment area of the basin under consideration. However, for certain hydrometeorological conditions and for small river basins this effect may lead to significant changes of the calculated hydrographs.

abstract = {Fingerprinting glacial silt in last glacial-age sediments from Upper Klamath Lake (UKL) and Bear Lake (BL) provides continuous radiocarbon-dated records of glaciation for the southeastern Cascade Range and northwestern Uinta Mountains, respectively. Comparing of these records to cosmogenic exposure ages from moraines suggests that variations in glacial flour largely reflect glacial extent. The two areas are at similar latitudes and yield similar records of glacial growth and recession, even though UKL lies less than 200. km from the ocean and BL is in the continental interior. As sea level began to fall prior to the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), existing glaciers in the UKL area expanded. Near the beginning of the global LGM (26.5 ka), the BL record indicates onset of glaciation and UKL-area glaciers underwent further expansion. Both records indicate that local glaciers reached their maximum extents near the end of the global LGM, remained near their maxima for $\sim$1000. yr, and underwent two stages of retreat separated by a short period of expansion. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {In the Southwest United States, water resources depend heavily on snowpacks, which are temporally and spatially limited in this warm, semiarid region. Snow accumulation and ablation in the Southwest are heavily influenced by forest structure. Therefore, water resource managers urgently need to understand the future impacts of unprecedented forest changes now occurring from drought, insect infestation, and forest management. Here, we present state-of-the-art maps and time series of snow water equivalent (SWE), which account for spatial variability of snow depth and snow density over a large range of forest structure and topographies in the highlands of central Arizona. We show that the degree of forest cover and its geometry largely determine which areas have more/less snow accumulation and faster/slower ablation. Compared with under-canopy areas, open areas can have 20–30% more accumulation and ablation rates can vary by 15–30% in sunny areas versus shaded areas. Although SWE response to forest cover is widely variable, depending on how much shading the trees provide versus how much snow is intercepted and lost through canopy sublimation, dense forests generally have less SWE than sparser forests. In general, SWE is optimized at intermediate levels of forest cover ($\sim$30–50%) on flat and north-facing slopes. Somewhat counterintuitively, increasing forest cover generally causes a reduction of SWE on south-facing slopes, where trees are less effective at reducing radiative forcing at the snow surface due to less efficient shading and increased enhancement of longwave radiation from the warm canopy.},

abstract = {SnowModel is a spatially distributed snow-evolution modeling system designed for application in landscapes, climates, and conditions where snow occurs. It is an aggregation of four submodels: MicroMet defines meteorological forcing conditions, EnBal calculates surface energy exchanges, SnowPack simulates snow depth and water-equivalent evolution, and SnowTran-3D accounts for snow redistribution by wind. Since each of these submodels was originally developed and tested for nonforested conditions, details describing modifications made to the submodels for forested areas are provided. SnowModel was created to run on grid increments of 1 to 200 m and temporal increments of 10 min to 1 day. It can also be applied using much larger grid increments, if the inherent loss in high-resolution (subgrid) information is acceptable. Simulated processes include snow accumulation; blowing-snow redistribution and sublimation; forest canopy interception, unloading, and sublimation; snow-density evolution; and snowpack melt. Conceptually, SnowModel includes the first-order physics required to simulate snow evolution within each of the global snow classes (i.e., ice, tundra, taiga, alpine/mountain, prairie, maritime, and ephemeral). The required model inputs are 1) temporally varying fields of precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, and relative humidity obtained from meteorological stations and/or an atmospheric model located within or near the simulation domain; and 2) spatially distributed fields of topography and vegetation type. SnowModel's ability to simulate seasonal snow evolution was compared against observations in both forested and nonforested landscapes. The model closely reproduced observed snow-water-equivalent distribution, time evolution, and interannual variability patterns.},

abstract = {This study proposed modifying the conceptual approach that is commonly used to model development of stand attribute estimates using airborne LiDAR data. New models were developed using an area-based approach to predict wood volume, stem volume, aboveground biomass, and basal-area across a wide range of canopy structures, sites and LiDAR characteristics. This new modeling approach does not adopt standard approaches of stepwise regression using a series of height metrics derived from airborne LiDAR. Rather, it used four metrics describing complementary 3D structural aspects of the stand canopy. The first three metrics were related to mean canopy height, height heterogeneity, and horizontal canopy distribution. A fourth metric was calculated as the coefficient of variation of the leaf area density profile. This fourth metric provided information on understory vegetation. The models that were developed with the four structural metrics provided higher estimation accuracy on stand attributes than models using height metrics alone, while also avoiding data over-fitting. Overall, the models provided prediction error levels ranging from 12.4% to 24.2%, depending upon forest type and stand attribute. The more homogeneous coniferous stand provided the highest estimation accuracy. Estimation errors were significantly reduced in mixed forest when separate models were developed for individual stand types (coniferous, mixed and deciduous stands) instead of a general model for all stand types. Model robustness was also evaluated in leaf-off and leaf-on conditions where both conditions provided similar estimation errors.},

Simulations of longwave irradiance to cirque floors within the study area reveal subtle variations that are due to differences in ground slope and the configuration of surrounding ridges. The simulated variations in longwave irradiance are not adequately represented by the commonly employed istoropic approximation. Surrounding rockwalls enhance the energy balance of alpine snowfields by reducing their net longwave loss circa 50% below that of an unobstructed ridge top.

Evidence of earlier, less-extensive Neoglacial glacier advances is based on wood recovered from several glacier forefields. Wood flushed out of Athabasca Glacier (7550-8230 yr B.P., three dates) and Dome Glacier (6120-6380 yr B.P., two dates) indicates that forests occurred upvalley of present glacier termini during the Hypsithermal. Detrital logs from Peyto (14 dates), Saskatchewan (3 dates), Robson (3 dates), and Yoho (1 date) Glaciers, plus in situ slumps at Peyto and Robson Glaciers, have yielded14C dates between 2490 and 3300 yr B.P.

(Treeline was higher than present immediately prior to this advance.) This advance, which did not extend beyond the Little Ice Age maximum position, is designated the Peyto Advance and correlated with the Tiedemann Advance in western British Columbia.

abstract = {Recent improvements in the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model are focused on snow–vegetation–atmosphere interactions to understand how different types of vegetation affect snow processes in the mountains of Western USA. This work presents field work carried out in the Rocky Mountains of Northern Utah to evaluate new UEB model algorithms that represent the processes of canopy snow interception, sublimation, mass unloading and melt. Four years' continuous field observations showed generally smaller accumulations of snow beneath the forest canopies in comparison with open (sage and grass) areas, a difference that is attributed to interception and subsequent sublimation and redistribution of intercepted snow by wind, much of it into surrounding open areas. Accumulations beneath the denser forest (conifer) canopies were found to be less than the accumulation beneath the less dense forest (deciduous) canopies. The model was able to represent the accumulation of snow water equivalent in the open and beneath the deciduous forest quite well but without accounting for redistribution tended to overestimate the snow water equivalent beneath the conifer forest. Evidence of redistribution of the intercepted snow from the dense forest (i.e. conifer forest) to the adjacent area was inferred from observations. Including a simple representation of redistribution in the model gave satisfactory prediction of snow water equivalent beneath the coniferous forest. The simulated values of interception, sublimation and unloading were also compared with previous studies and found in agreement. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change is anticipated to have impacts on the water resources of the Saskatchewan River, which originates in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. To better understand the climate change impacts in the mountain headwaters of this basin, a physically based hydrological model was developed for this basin using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM) for Marmot Creek Research Basin ($\sim$9.4 km 2), located in the Front Ranges of the Canadian Rocky Mountain. Marmot Creek is composed of ecozones ranging from montane forests to alpine tundra and alpine exposed rock and includes both large 10 and small clearcuts. The model included blowing and intercepted snow redistribution, sublimation, energy-balance snowmelt, slope and canopy effects on melt, Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration, infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils, hillslope hydrology, streamflow routing and groundwater components and was parameterised without calibration from streamflow. Near-surface outputs from the 4-km Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were bias corrected using the quantile delta mapping method with respect to meteorological data from five stations located from montane forest to mountaintop 15 during October 2005-September 2013. The bias corrected WRF outputs during current period (CTRL, 2005-2013) and future period (PGW, 2091-2099) were used to drive model simulations to assess changes in Marmot Creek's hydrology. Under a "business as usual" forcing scenario: representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) in PGW, the basin warms up by 4.7 °C and receives 16% more precipitation, which leads to a 40 mm decline in seasonal peak snowpack, 84 mm decrease in snowmelt volume, 0.2 mm day-1 slower melt rate, and 49 days shorter snowcover duration. The alpine snow season will be 20 shortened by almost one and half month, but at some lower elevations there are large decreases in peak snowpack ($\sim$45%) as well as a shorter snow season. Losses of peak snowpack will be much greater in clearcuts than under forest canopies. In alpine and treeline ecozones blowing snow transport and sublimation will be suppressed by higher threshold wind speeds for transport, in forest canopies sublimation losses from intercepted snow will decrease due to faster unloading and drip, and for all ecozones, evapotranspiration will increase due to longer snow-free seasons and more rainfall. Runoff will begin earlier in 25 all ecozones, but, as result of variability in surface and subsurface hydrology, forested and alpine ecozones generate larger runoff volumes, ranging from 12% to 25%, whereas the treeline ecozone has a small (2%) decrease in runoff volume due to decreased melt volumes from smaller snowdrifts. The shift in timing in streamflow is notable, with 236% higher flows in spring months and 12% lower flows in summer and 13% higher flows in early fall. Overall, Marmot Creek basin annual streamflow discharge will increase by 18% with PGW without a change in its streamflow generation efficiency, despite the 30 basin shifting from snowmelt runoff towards rainfall-dominated runoff generation.},

abstract = {Orographic precipitation and snowpack provide a vital water resource for the western U.S., while convective precipitation accounts for a significant part of annual precipitation in the eastern U.S. As a result, water managers are keenly interested in their fate under climate change. However, previous studies of water cycle changes in the U.S. have been conducted with climate models of relatively coarse resolution, leading to potential misrepresentation of key physical processes. This paper presents results from a high-resolution climate change simulation that permits convection and resolves mesoscale orography at 4-km grid spacing over much of North America using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Two 13-year simulations were performed, consisting of a retrospective simulation (October 2000–September 2013) with initial and boundary conditions from ERA-interim and a future climate sensitivity simulation with modified reanalysis-derived initial and boundary conditions through adding the CMIP5 ensemble-mean high-end emission scenario climate change. The retrospective simulation is evaluated by validating against Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) and an ensemble of gridded observational datasets. It shows overall good performance capturing the annual/seasonal/sub-seasonal precipitation and surface temperature climatology except for a summer dry and warm bias in the central U.S. In particular, the WRF seasonal precipitation agrees with SNOTEL observations within a few percent over the mountain ranges, providing confidence in the model's estimation of western U.S. seasonal snowfall and snowpack. The future climate simulation forced with warmer and moister perturbed boundary conditions enhances annual and winter-spring-fall seasonal precipitation over most of the contiguous United States (CONUS), but suppresses summertime precipitation in the central U.S. The WRF-downscaled climate change simulations provide a high-resolution dataset (i.e., High-Resolution CONUS downscaling, HRCONUS) to the community for studying one possible scenario of regional climate changes and impacts.},

abstract = {With the emergence of water supply and food security issues as a result of increasing population and climate change pressures, the need for efficient use of available water supplies is paramount. Management of available resources and improved efficiency require accurate specification of evaporation, which is a major water loss pathway, yet evaporation remains difficult to accurately quantify. This study uses scintillometry-derived measurements of evaporation to test the performance of water balance, pan coefficient, and combination modeling techniques, which might commonly be used by resource managers. Both pan coefficient and water balance techniques performed poorly, but the Penman-Monteith model with local site data and site-specific wind function produced estimates within 2% of those measured. Recognizing that such a model parameterization would rarely be a possibility in most environments, further testing involving the range of data sets that might be available for a location was undertaken. Modeling using over-water measurements and, generally, applicable wind functions from the literature produced estimates 26% greater than those measured. Estimates within 12% of those measured were made for the equivalent model setup using over-land meteorological data; however, when data from the nearest meteorological station was used, this difference increased to 27%. The different evaporation estimation techniques tested were shown to produce a range of estimates of water availability, which varied by nearly 30%. The large differences between measured and predicted evaporation highlight the uncertainty that still exists in evaporation estimation and the sensitivity of predictions to the source of input data. {\textcopyright}2013.

While there is increasing motivation for modelling at hyper-resolution (< 1 km) and snowdrift-resolving scales (≈ 1 to 100 m), the capabilities of existing cold-region hydrological models are computation-ally limited at these scales. Here, a new distributed model, the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM), is presented. Although designed to be applied generally, it has a focus for application where cold-region processes play a role in hydrology. Key features include the ability to do the following: capture spatial hetero-geneity in the surface discretization in an efficient manner via variable-resolution unstructured meshes; include multiple process representations; change, remove, and decouple hydrological process algorithms; work at both a point and spatially distributed scale; scale to multiple spatial extents and scales; and utilize a variety of forcing fields (bound-ary and initial conditions). This paper focuses on the overall model philosophy and design, and it provides a number of cold-region-specific features and examples.},

These new estimates were compared to estimates made from the three stations used internationally to estimate flow to ocean stations in this region. Complications with simple reconstructions and estimates for ungauged areas are discussed with respect to hydrologic process and limits to the use of the data. These monthly estimates attempt to better reflect the seasonal patterns of streamflow from a complex hydrological area where streamflow is generated through a mixture of pluvial, nival, and glacial processes. These new estimates suggest much larger volumes of freshwater flow into the North Pacific than those based upon only the three 'flow to ocean' stations. The methodologies used demonstrate what idiosyncrasies must be considered to improve means to extrapolate monthly discharges in this hydrologically complex region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Late-Preboreal deglaciation is indicated by lake-floor accumulation of organic matter (gyttja) largely replacing minerogenic sediment before 9000 cal. BP. A distinct minerogenic layer is thought to represent glacier expansion during the 8.2 ka Finse Event. Following this event until c. 2200 cal. BP, glaciers were mostly smaller than today, indicated by slow accumulation of mainly gyttja with predominantly thin minerogenic layers. A trough in LOI and corresponding small peaks in different silt fractions indicate possible glacial expansion from c. 3500 to 3000 cal. BP. The shorter c. 7500 year stream-bank mire record suggests brief, distinct episodes of Neoglacial glacier activity at c. 5600 and 3650 cal. BP. After c. 2200 cal. BP, up to three possible glacier expansion events are indicated in the lake core compared with up to eight represented in the mire sequences, suggesting greater sensitivity of the latter to small-scale glacier expansion. Marked 'suppressed' Neoglacial expansion until after c. 2200 cal. BP contrasts with the more typically reported start at 6000-5300 cal. BP elsewhere in southern Norway. Methodological implications are discussed including: factors responsible for erroneous radiocarbon dates in mire and lake core stratigraphies; high spatial variability in mire stratigraphy; determining the amplitude of glacier contraction episodes; isolating the glacial signal from background 'noise'; and further improvement of dating. {\textcopyright} 2007 SAGE Publications.},

We outline the historical modeling challenges, provide examples of modeling advances that address these challenges, and define outstanding research needs. We illustrate how modeling advances have been made by groups using models of different type and complexity, and we argue for the need to more effectively use our diversity of modeling approaches in order to advance our collective quest for physically realistic hydrologic models.},

abstract = {<p>A simple approach to glacier dynamics is explored in which there is postulated to be a relationship between area and volume with three parameters: the time for area to respond to changes in volume, a thickness scale, and an area characterizing the condition of the initial state.This approach gives a good fit to the measurements of cumulative balance and area on South Cascade Glacier from 1970–97; the area time-scale is roughly 8 years, the thickness scale about 123 m, and the 1970 area roughly 4% larger than required for adjustment with volume. Combining this relationship with a version of mass continuity expressed in terms of area and volume produces a theory of glacier area and volume response to climate in which another time constant, the volume time-scale, appears. Area and volume both respond like a damped spring and mass system. The damping of the South Cascade response is approximately critical, and the volume time-scale is roughly 48 years, six times the area time-scale. The critically damped spring and mass analogy reproduces the time dependence predicted by the more complicated traditional theory of Nye.</p>},

Varve thickness is positively correlated with July–August–September temperature measured at Clyde River, 70 km to the north of the lake (r = 0.46, p\0.001). We therefore interpret the variability and trends in varve thickness to partially represent summer temperature. The coolest Little Ice Age temperatures occurred in this record from 1575 to 1760 AD and were approximately 1.5C cooler than today (average from 1995 to 2005 AD) and 0.2C cooler than the last millennium (average from 1000 to 2000 AD). Pre-twentieth-century warmth occurred during two intervals, 970–1150 AD and 1375–1575 AD; temperatures were approximately 1.2C cooler than today, but 0.1C warmer than the last millennium.

abstract = {Abstract Previous research has highlighted the relationship between snow accumulation and forest stand characteristics, as well as the effects of topography, but not the variability within stands. This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33\% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43\%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

abstract = {The Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC) is an open-source community model designed to address research questions that explore the role of the land surface in the global climate system. Here, we evaluate how well CLASSIC reproduces the energy, water, and carbon cycle when forced with quasi-observed meteorological data. Model skill scores summarize how well model output agrees with observation-based reference data across multiple statistical metrics. A lack of agreement may be due to deficiencies in the model, its forcing data, and/or reference data. To address uncertainties in the forcing, we evaluate an ensemble of CLASSIC runs that is based on three meteorological data sets. To account for observational uncertainty, we compute benchmark skill scores that quantify the level of agreement among independent reference data sets. The benchmark scores demonstrate what score values a model may realistically achieve given the uncertainties in the observations. Our results show that uncertainties associated with the forcing and observations are considerably large. For instance, for 10 out of 19 variables assessed in this study, the sign of the bias changes depending on what forcing and reference data are used. Benchmark scores are much lower than expected, implying large observational uncertainties. Model and benchmark score values are mostly similar, indicating that CLASSIC performs well when considering observational uncertainty. Future model development should address (i) a positive albedo bias and resulting shortwave radiation bias in parts of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics and Tibetan Plateau, (ii) an out-of-phase seasonal gross primary productivity cycle in the humid tropics of South America and Africa, (iii) a lacking spatial correlation of annual mean net ecosystem exchange with site-level measurements, (iv) an underestimation of fractional area burned and corresponding emissions in the boreal forests, (v) a negative soil organic carbon bias in high latitudes, and (vi) a time lag in seasonal leaf area index maxima in parts of the NH extratropics. Our results will serve as a baseline for guiding and monitoring future CLASSIC development./p.},

abstract = {There are an increasing number of digital elevation models (DEMs) available worldwide for deriving elevation differences over time, including vertical changes on glaciers. Most of these DEMs are heavily post-processed or merged, so that physical error modelling becomes difficult and statistical error modelling is required instead. We propose a three-step methodological framework for assessing and correcting DEMs to quantify glacier elevation changes: (i) remove DEM shifts, (ii) check for elevation-dependent biases, and (iii) check for higher-order, sensor-specific biases. A simple, analytic and robust method to co-register elevation data is presented in regions where stable terrain is either plentiful (case study New Zealand) or limited (case study Svalbard). The method is demonstrated using the three global elevation data sets available to date, SRTM, ICESat and the ASTER GDEM, and with automatically generated DEMs from satellite stereo instruments of ASTER and SPOT5-HRS. After 3-D co-registration, significant biases related to elevation were found in some of the stereoscopic DEMs. Biases related to the satellite acquisition geometry (along/cross track) were detected at two frequencies in the automatically generated ASTER DEMs. The higher frequency bias seems to be related to satellite jitter, most apparent in the back-looking pass of the satellite. The origins of the more significant lower frequency bias is uncertain. ICESat-derived elevations are found to be the most consistent globally available elevation data set available so far. Before performing regional-scale glacier elevation change studies or mosaicking DEMs from multiple individual tiles (e.g. ASTER GDEM), we recommend to co-register all elevation data to ICESat as a global vertical reference system. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {Within mountainous regions, estimating the exchange of sensible heat and water vapor between the surface and the atmosphere is an important but inexact endeavor. Measurements of the turbulence characteristics of the near-surface boundary layer in complex mountain terrain are relatively scarce, leading to considerable uncertainty in the application of flux-gradient techniques for estimating the surface turbulent heat and mass fluxes. An investigation of the near-surface boundary layer within a 7-ha snow-covered forest clearing was conducted in the Kananaskis River valley, located within the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The homogeneous measurement site was characterized as being relatively calm and sheltered; the wind exhibited considerable unsteadiness, however. Frequent wind gusts were observed to transport turbulent energy into the clearing, affecting the rate of energy transfer at the snow surface. The resulting boundary layer within the clearing exhibited perturbations introduced by the surrounding topography and land surface discontinuities. The measured momentum flux did not scale with the local aerodynamic roughness and mean wind speed profile, but rather was reflective of the larger-scale topographical disturbances. The intermittent nature of the fluxgenerating processes was evident in the turbulence spectra and cospectra where the peak energy was shifted to lower frequencies as compared with those observed in more homogeneous flat terrain. The contribution of intermittent events was studied using quadrant analysis, which revealed that 50% of the sensible and latent heat fluxes was contributed from motions that occupied less than 6% of the time. These results highlight the need for caution while estimating the turbulent heat and mass fluxes in mountain regions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Lillooet River in southwest British Columbia has produced damaging floods many times during the past century. The floods are recorded in Lillooet Lake, into which the river flows, as anomalously thick clastic varves. In order to determine whether an 825-year long varve record obtained from 12 percussion and vibracores can be used as flood proxy, we compare river discharge records dating back to 1914 to the thickness of the varves deposited during the same time period. Correlations between varve thickness and a variety of historical discharge measures are low to moderate for the periods 1914-2004 (r2= 0.37) and 1914-1945 (r2= 0.40), but higher for the period 1946-2004 (r2= 0.55). The best correlation (r2= 0.55) is between maximum fall discharge and varve thickness during the most recent period (1946-2004). Varve thickness for the earlier period of hydrometric data (1914-1946), which is a time of rapid glacier retreat and warmer temperatures in British Columbia, is best explained with a discharge proxy combining nival runoff, glacier runoff, and maximum fall discharge. Landslides, glacier fluctuations, river dyking, artificial lowering of Lillooet Lake, as well as lag effects of storms are responsible for the considerable unexplained variance in the relation between discharge measures and varve thickness over the historic period. The cores contain many anomalously thick varves, some of which we attribute to previously dated prehistoric landslides in the watershed or to local landslides into the lake. We conclude that many historic and prehistoric floods are faithfully recorded as anomalously thick clastic varves, but that other processes operating in the watershed preclude using this record as a reliable paleo-flood proxy.},

abstract = {The variation of snow albedo with wavelength across the solar spectrum from 0.3 $\mu$m in the ultraviolet (UV) to 2.5 $\mu$m in the near infrared (IR) was measured at Amundsen‐Scott South Pole Station during the Antarctic summers of 1985–1986 and 1990–1991. Similar results were obtained at Vostok Station in summer 1990–1991. The albedo has a uniformly high value of 0.96–0.98 across the UV and visible spectrum, nearly independent of snow grain size and solar zenith angle, and this value probably applies throughout the interior of Antarctica. The albedo in the near IR is lower, dropping below 0.15 in the strong absorption bands at 1.5 and 2.0 $\mu$m; and it is quite sensitive to grain size and somewhat sensitive to zenith angle. Near‐IR albedos were slightly lower at Vostok than at South Pole, but day‐to‐day variations in the measured grain size due to precipitation, drifting, and metamorphism were found to cause temporal variations in near‐IR albedo larger than those due to any systematic geographical change from South Pole to Vostok. The spectrally averaged albedos ranged from 0.80 to 0.85 for both overcast and clear skies, in agreement with measurements by others at South Pole and elsewhere in Antarctica. Using a two‐layer radiative transfer model, the albedo can be explained over the full wavelength range. Tests were made to correct for systematic errors in determining spectral albedo. Under clear skies at about 3000‐m elevation the diffuse fraction of downward irradiance varied from 0.4 in the near UV to less than 0.01 in the near IR; knowledge of this fraction is required to correct the measured irradiance for the instrument's deviation from a perfect cosine‐response. Furthermore, the deviation from cosine response is itself a function of wavelength. Under clear skies a significant error in apparent albedo can result if the instrument's cosine collector is not parallel to the surface; e.g., if the instrument is leveled parallel to the horizon, but the local snow surface is not horizontal. The soot content of the snow upwind of South Pole Station was only 0.3 ng/g. It was somewhat greater at Vostok Station but was still too small to affect the albedo at any wavelength. Bidirectional reflectance at 0.9‐$\mu$m wavelength, measured from a 23‐m tower at the end of summer after the sastrugi (snow dunes) had diminished, showed a pattern remarkably similar to the spectrally averaged pattern obtained from the Nimbus 7 satellite.},

abstract = {Estimation of snow depth in the forest-tundra landscape remains a challenge because of a lack of reliable and frequent observations on precipitation and snow depth. Snow models forced by gridded meteorological datasets are often the only option available for assessing snow depth at the local scale. Unfortunately, these models generally do not take into account the snow redistribution process between open and forested areas which frequently occurs in the forest-tundra landscape. A simple modification to an existing snow accumulation and melt model is proposed in order to allow for snow redistribution. Along with a technique for taking advantage of snow depth observations obtained from a digital camera, the model is shown to provide accurate predictions of snow depth at the local scale when forced with precipitation data from Environment Canada's Canadian Precipitation Analysis. Results from this study suggest that instrumenting automated weather stations with a digital camera, together with small modifications to an existing model used operationally for snow depth prediction, could result in significant improvements to snow depth prediction and analysis in this environment. Further testing at sites where snow water equivalent of the snowpack is available should, however, be performed to fully validate the method.},

Characterizing forest soil properties with high variability is challenging, sometimes requiring large numbers of soil samples. Soil bulk density is a standard variable needed along with element concentrations to calculate nutrient pools. This study aimed to determine the optimal sample size, the number of observation (n), for predicting the soil bulk density with a precision of ±10% at a 95% confidence level among different soil types. We determined soil bulk density samples at three depths at 186 points distributed over three different 1-ha forest sites. We calculated n needed for estimating means of bulk density using a traditional method. This estimate was compared to a bootstrapping method n where the variance was estimated by re-sampling our original sample over 500 times. The results showed that patterns of soil bulk density varied by sites. Bootstrapping indicated 3 to 17 samples were needed to estimate mean soil bulk density at ± 10% at a 95% confidence level at the three sites and three depths. Sample sizes determined by the bootstrap method were larger than the numbers estimated by the traditional method. Bootstrapping is considered theoretically to be more robust, especially at a site with more variability or for site measures that are not normally distributed.},

abstract = {Snowfall interception is particularly important to the hydrology of forested cold regions. Unloading of intercepted snow controls the snow available for interception loss due to sublimation from that held in the canopy. This thesis seeks to determine the factors that affect the magnitude and timing of unloading at the forest-stand scale. A field program was established that measured interception and unloading at a forest-stand scale using a series of hanging lysimeters and a 7 m tall spruce tree suspended, in-situ, on a load-cell.Meteorological conditions including snowfall, wind speed, air temperature, and incoming radiation were recorded above and below the forest canopy. Unloading did not behave as described by current unloading models. It was observed to be triggered by occurrences of wind gusts or melt conditions within the canopy but no trends were found in the measurements that could be used to predict the onset of unloading from gusts or air temperature alone. An association between intercepted snow sublimation and unloading was found and this relationship was further found to be an exponential function of air temperature. An expression based on this empirical model can be used to calculate unloading as a function of sublimation rate in hydrological models or to calculate unloading directly as a function of canopy snow load and air temperature.},

abstract = {Snow is among the most "colorful" materials in nature, but most of the variability in snow reflectance occurs beyond 0.8 $\mu$m rather than in the visible spectrum. In these wavelengths, reflectance decreases dramatically as the snow grains evolve and grow, whereas in the visible spectrum snow reflectance is degraded by contaminants such as dust, algae, and soot. From imaging spectrometer data, we can estimate the grain size of the snow in the surface layer, and thereby derive spectral and broadband albedo. We can also estimate the fraction of each pixel that is covered by snow, the liquid water content in the surface layer, and the amount of radiative forcing caused by absorbing impurities. Estimates of fractional snow-covered area and albedo dramatically improve the performance of spatially distributed snowmelt models that include net solar radiation as an input value, most significantly in locations and at times where incident solar radiation is high and temperatures low. Experience with imaging spectrometer data has allowed extension of the fractional snow-cover and albedo estimates to multispectral sensors, particularly MODIS, the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Snow interception by the forest canopy controls the spatial heterogeneity of subcanopy snow accumulation leading to significant differences between forested and nonforested areas at a variety of scales. Snow intercepted by the forest canopy can also drastically change the surface albedo. As such, accurately modeling snow interception is of importance for various model applications such as hydrological, weather, and climate predictions. Due to difficulties in the direct measurements of snow interception, previous empirical snow interception models were developed at just the point scale. The lack of spatially extensive data sets has hindered the validation of snow interception models in different snow climates, forest types, and at various spatial scales and has reduced the accurate representation of snow interception in coarse-scale models. We present two novel empirical models for the spatial mean and one for the standard deviation of snow interception derived from an extensive snow interception data set collected in an evergreen coniferous forest in the Swiss Alps. Besides open-site snowfall, subgrid model input parameters include the standard deviation of the DSM (digital surface model) and/or the sky view factor, both of which can be easily precomputed. Validation of both models was performed with snow interception data sets acquired in geographically different locations under disparate weather conditions. Snow interception data sets from the Rocky Mountains, US, and the French Alps compared well to the modeled snow interception with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) for the spatial mean of ≤10% for both models and NRMSE of the standard deviation of ≤13%. Compared to a previous model for the spatial mean interception of snow water equivalent, the presented models show improved model performances. Our results indicate that the proposed snow interception models can be applied in coarse land surface model grid cells provided that a sufficiently fine-scale DSM is available to derive subgrid forest parameters.},

At the centennial time scale, the Medieval Climate Anomaly {(MCA),} Little Ice Age {(LIA)} and Current Warm Period {(CWP)} are distinct in the Basomtso region. Rapid climate fluctuations inferred from five episodes with higher sediment input and likely warmer conditions, as well as seven episodes with lower sediment input and likely colder conditions, were well preserved in our record. These episodes with higher and lower sediment input are characterized by abrupt climate changes and short time durations.

The field study was further intended to provide data to develop and test models of forest canopy effects on beneath-canopy snowpack accumulation and melt and the plot and stand scales. Weighing lysimeters, cut-tree experiments, and manual snow surveys were deployed at a site in the Umpqua National Forest, Oregon (elevation 1200 m). A unique design for a weighing lysimeter was employed that allowed continuous measurements of snowpack evolution beneath a forest canopy to be taken at a scale unaffected by variability in canopy throughfall. Continuous observations of snowpack evolution in large clearings were made coincidentally with the canopy measurements. Large differences in snow accumulation and ablation were observed at sites beneath the forest canopy and in large clearings. These differences were not well described by simple relationships between the sites. Over the study period, approximately 60% of snowfall was intercepted by the canopy (up to a maximum of about 40 mm water equivalent). Instantaneous sublimation rates exceeded 0.5 mm per hour for short periods. However, apparent average sublimation from the intercepted snow was less than 1 mm per day and totaled approximately 100 mm per winter season. Approximately 72 and 28% of the remaining intercepted snow was removed as meltwater drip and large snow masses, respectively. Observed differences in snow interception rate and maximum snow interception capacity between Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) were minimal.},

abstract = {In many parts of the world, snowmelt energetics is dominated by solar irradiance. This is particularly the case in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, where clear skies dominate the winter and spring. In mountainous regions, solar irradiance at the snow surface is not only affected by solar angles, atmospheric transmittance, the slope and aspect of immediate topography but also by shadows from surrounding terrain. Accumulation of errors in estimating solar irradiation can lead to significant errors in calculating the timing and rate of snowmelt owing to the seasonal storage of internal energy in the snowpack. Gridded methods, which are often used to estimate solar irradiance in complex terrain, work best with high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), such as those produced using Light Detection and Ranging. However, such methods also introduce errors caused by the rigid nature of the mesh as well as limiting the ability to represent basin characteristics. Unstructured triangular meshes are more efficient in their use of DEM data than fixed grids when producing solar irradiance information for spatially distributed snowmelt calculations, and they do not suffer from the artefact problems of a gridded DEM. This paper demonstrates the increased accuracy of using a horizon-shading algorithm model with an unstructured mesh versus standard self-shading algorithms. A systematic over-prediction in irradiance is observed when only self-shadows are considered. The modelled results are diagnosed by comparison to measurements of mountain shadows by time-lapse digital cameras and solar irradiance by a network of radiometers in Marmot Creek Research Basin, Alberta, Canada. Results show that, depending on the depth and aspect of the snowpack of the Mount Allan cirque, 6.0 to 66.4% of the pre-melt snowpack could be prematurely melted. On average at a basin scale, there was a 14.4-mm SWE difference in equivalent melt energy between the two shading algorithms with maximum differences over 100% of the total annual snowfall. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The continental divide along the spine of the Canadian Rockies in southwestern Canada is a critical headwater region for hydrological drainages to the Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic oceans. Major flooding events are typically attributed to heavy precipitation on its eastern side due to upslope (easterly) flows. Precipitation can also occur on the western side of the divide when moisture originating from the Pacific Ocean encounters the west-facing slopes of the Canadian Rockies. Often, storms propagating across the divide result in significant precipitation on both sides. Meteorological data over this critical region are sparse, with few stations located at high elevations. Given the importance of all these types of events, the Storms and Precipitation Across the continental Divide Experiment (SPADE) was initiated to enhance our knowledge of the atmospheric processes leading to storms and precipitation on either side of the continental divide. This was accomplished by installing specialized meteorological instrumentation on both sides of the continental divide and carrying out manual observations during an intensive field campaign from 24 April-26 June 2019. On the eastern side, there were two field sites: (i) at Fortress Mountain Powerline (2076 m a.s.l.) and (ii) at Fortress Junction Service, located in a high-elevation valley (1580 m a.s.l.). On the western side, Nipika Mountain Resort, also located in a valley (1087 m a.s.l.), was chosen as a field site. Various meteorological instruments were deployed including two Doppler light detection and ranging instruments (lidars), three vertically pointing micro rain radars, and three optical disdrometers. The three main sites were nearly identically instrumented, and observers were on site at Fortress Mountain Powerline and Nipika Mountain Resort during precipitation events to take manual observations of precipitation type and microphotographs of solid particles. The objective of the field campaign was to gather high-Temporal-frequency meteorological data and to compare the different conditions on either side of the divide to study the precipitation processes that can lead to catastrophic flooding in the region. Details on field sites, instrumentation used, and collection methods are discussed. Data from the study are publicly accessible from the Federated Research Data Repository at <a hrefCombining double low (Th{\'{e}}riault et al., 2020). This dataset will be used to study atmospheric conditions associated with precipitation events documented simultaneously on either side of a continental divide. This paper also provides a sample of the data gathered during a precipitation event.</p>.},

abstract = {A suite of sediment core samples was recovered from two lakes, Crowfoot and Bow lakes, that are adjacent to the Crowfoot moraine type locality, to identify and radiocarbon date sediments related to the Crowfoot advance. The Crowfoot moraine system, widely recognized throughout northwestern North America, represents a glacial advance that is post-Wisconsin and pre-Mazama tephra in age. An interval of inorganic sediments bracketed by accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon ages of ca. 11,330 and 10,100 C-14 yr B.P. is associated with the Crowfoot moraine. The Crowfoot advance is therefore approximately synchronous with the European Younger Dryas cold event (ca. 11,000-10,000 C-14 yr B.P.). Furthermore, the termination of the Crowfoot advance also appears to have been abrupt. These findings illustrate that the climatic change responsible for the European Younger Dryas event extended beyond the northern Atlantic basin and western Europe. Equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) depressions associated with the Crowfoot advance are similar to those determined for the Little Ice Age advance, whereas Younger Dryas EIA depressions in Europe significantly exceed Little Ice Age ELA depressions.},

abstract = {Snow disappearance date (SDD) affects the ecohydrological dynamics of montane forests, by altering water availability, forest fire regime, and the land surface energy budget. The forest canopy modulates SDD through competing processes; dense canopy intercepts snowfall and enhances longwave radiation while shading snowpack from shortwave radiation and sheltering it from the wind. Limited ground-based observations of snow presence and absence have restricted our ability to unravel the dominant processes affecting SDD in montane forests. We apply a lidar-derived method to estimate fractional snow cover area (fSCA) at two relatively warm sites in the Sierra Nevada and two colder sites in the Rocky Mountains, which we link to SDD. With the exception of late season snowpack and low fSCA, snow retention is longer under low vegetation density than under high vegetation density in both warm and cold sites. Warm forests consistently have longer snow retention in open areas compared to dense under canopy areas, particularly on south-facing slopes. Cold forests tend to have longer snow retention under lower density canopy compared to open areas, particularly on north-facing slopes. We use this empirical analysis to make process inferences and develop an initial framework to predict SDD that incorporates the role of topography and vegetation structure. Building on our framework will be necessary to provide better forest management recommendations for snowpack retention across complex terrain and heterogenous canopy structure.},

Six key subthemes emerged: sediment connectivity, hydrologic connectivity, geochemical connectivity, riverine connectivity, landscape connectivity, and modeling of connectivity. Papers presented at the symposium and collected in this special issue elucidate the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of connectivity but also provide field-based and analytical approaches to document the fundamental role of connectivity in geomorphic and ecological functioning. Among the consistent themes that emerged from the papers and from discussion during the symposium were (1) the interconnectedness of diverse forms of connectivity, (2) the appropriateness (or not) of conceptualizing connectivity as a gradient or continuum, and (3) the importance of an explicit recognition of disconnectivity as a mechanism to retain ecologically important materials and organisms within landscapes. Knowledge gaps identified in discussions during the symposium include: identifying questions that can be usefully addressed within a framework emphasizing connectivity; identifying feedbacks that enhance and limit connectivity; and quantification – of diverse aspects of connectivity, of thresholds of connectivity, and of interactions among different types of connectivity.},

abstract = {<p>Quantifying the spatial distribution of snow is crucial to predict and assess its water resource potential and understand land&ndash;atmosphere interactions. High-resolution remote sensing of snow depth has been limited to terrestrial and airborne laser scanning and more recently with application of structure from motion (SfM) techniques to airborne (manned and unmanned) imagery. In this study, photography from a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to generate digital surface models (DSMs) and orthomosaics for snow cover at a cultivated agricultural Canadian prairie and a sparsely vegetated Rocky Mountain alpine ridgetop site using SfM. The accuracy and repeatability of this method to quantify snow depth, changes in depth and its spatial variability was assessed for different terrain types over time. Root mean square errors in snow depth estimation from differencing snow-covered and non-snow-covered DSMs were 8.8 cm for a short prairie grain stubble surface, 13.7 cm for a tall prairie grain stubble surface and 8.5 cm for an alpine mountain surface. This technique provided useful information on maximum snow accumulation and snow-covered area depletion at all sites, while temporal changes in snow depth could also be quantified at the alpine site due to the deeper snowpack and consequent higher signal-to-noise ratio. The application of SfM to UAV photographs returns meaningful information in areas with mean snow depth  &gt;  30 cm, but the direct observation of snow depth depletion of shallow snowpacks with this method is not feasible. Accuracy varied with surface characteristics, sunlight and wind speed during the flight, with the most consistent performance found for wind speeds  &lt;&thinsp;10 m s<sup>−1</sup>, clear skies, high sun angles and surfaces with negligible vegetation cover.</p>},

abstract = {Earth's energy balance is key to understanding climate and climate variations that are caused by natural and anthropogenic changes in the atmospheric composition. Despite abundant observational evidence for changes in the energy balance over the past decades(1-3), the formal detection of climate warming and its attribution to human influence has so far relied mostly on the difference between spatio-temporal warming patterns of natural and anthropogenic origin(4-6). Here we present an alternative attribution method that relies on the principle of conservation of energy, without assumptions about spatial warming patterns. Based on a massive ensemble of simulations with an intermediate-complexity climate model we demonstrate that known changes in the global energy balance and in radiative forcing tightly constrain the magnitude of anthropogenic warming. We find that since the mid-twentieth century, greenhouse gases contributed 0.85 degrees C of warming (5-95% uncertainty: 0.6-1.1 degrees C), about half of which was offset by the cooling effects of aerosols, with a total observed change in global temperature of about 0.56 degrees C. The observed trends are extremely unlikely (<5%) to be caused by internal variability, even if current models were found to strongly underestimate it. Our method is complementary to optimal fingerprinting attribution and produces fully consistent results, thus suggesting an even higher confidence that human-induced causes dominate the observed warming.},

abstract = {Complex and rugged topography induces large variations in erosion and sediment delivery in the headwaters of alpine catchments. An effective connection of hillslopes with the channel network results in highly efficient sediment transfer processes, such as debris flows. In contrast, morphological conditions producing decoupling of hillslopes from channels (e.g. glacial cirques) may exclude large areas of the catchment from sediment delivery to its lower parts. Moreover, an efficient connection between hillslopes and channel network does not always ensure an effective downstream transfer of sediment. Low-slope channel reaches (e.g. in hanging valleys) cause sediment deposition, which often results in changes of the sediment transport processes, typically from debris flow to streamflow with low bedload and suspended load rates. The availability of high-resolution digital terrain models, such as those derived from aerial LiDAR, improves our capability to quantify the topographic controls on sediment connectivity. A geomorphometric index, based on the approach by Borselli et al. (2008), was developed and applied to assess spatial sediment connectivity in two small catchments of the Italian Alps featuring contrasting morphological characteristics. The results of the geomorphometric analysis were checked against field evidences, showing good performance and thus potential usefulness of the index. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Measurements from the first outdoor application of particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) of near-surface blowing snow yield new information on mechanisms for blowing snow initiation, entrainment, and rebound, whilst also confirming some findings from wind tunnel observations. Blowing snow particle movement is influenced by complex surface flow dynamics, including saltation development from creep that has not previously been measured for snow. Comparisons with 3-D atmospheric turbulence measurements show that blowing snow particle motion immediately above the snow surface responds strongly to high-frequency turbulent motions. Momentum exchange from wind to the dense near-surface particle-laden flow appears significant and makes an important contribution to blowing snow mass flux and saltation initiation dynamics. The more complete and accurate description of near-surface snow particle motions observable using PTV may prove useful for improving blowing snow model realism and accuracy.},

Watersheds draining temperate rainforests, peatlands, glaciers, and three large rivers that flow from the drier interior of the Yukon Territory and British Columbia discharge water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into southeast Alaskan coastal waters. This area, which we have designated the southeast Alaska drainage basin (SEAKDB), discharges about twice as much water as the Columbia or Yukon Rivers. An understanding of the timing, location, and source of water and DOC guides research to better understand the influence of terrestrial outputs on the adjacent marine systems. Additionally, a spatially extensive understanding of riverine DOC flux will improve our understanding of lateral losses related to terrestrial carbon cycling. We estimate 1.17 Tg C yr−1 of DOC enters the adjacent marine system along with 430 km2 of freshwater that influences estuary, shelf, and Gulf of Alaska hydrology. We estimate that 23% to 66% of the DOC entering coastal waters is bioavailable and may influence metabolism and productivity within the marine system. The combination of the large and spatially distributed water and DOC input, long and complex shoreline, large enclosed estuarine volume, and bounded nearshore coastal currents suggests that the physiographic structure of southeast Alaska may have a significant impact on the metabolism of riverine DOC in coastal marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Snow interception in cold regions needleleaf forest canopies is a crucial process that controls local snow accumulation and redistribution over >20% of the Earth's land surface. Various ground-based methods exist to measure intercepted snow load, however all are based on single-tree measurements and are difficult to implement. No research has focussed on detecting large areal intercepted snow loads and no studies have assessed the use of satellite observations. In this study, four remote sensing indices (NDSI, NDVI, albedo, and land surface temperature (LST)) were retrieved from Landsat images to study their sensitivity to canopy intercepted snow and the possibility of using them to detect the presence of intercepted snow. The results indicate that presence of intercepted snow on canopy increased NDSI and albedo, but decreased NDVI. Intercepted snow presence also decreased the areal variability of NDSI and NDVI while increasing that of albedo. For these three indices, the differences between snow-free and snowcovered canopies were correlated to topography and forest canopy cover. Of these indices, NDSI changed the greatest. Intercepted snow noticeably decreased the LST difference between forest and open areas in springtime while the influence in wintertime was relatively smaller. An intercepted snow detection approach that uses both NDSI and NDVI to classify pixels into either snowcovered canopy or other (snow-free canopy and non-forest areas) is proposed here. A case study applying this approach compared remote sensing detection to simulations by the snow interception and sublimation model implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM). This used local meteorological observations from the pine, spruce and fir forest covered Marmot Creek Research Basin in the Canadian Rockies. The remote sensing detection of intercepted snow agreed well with CRHM simulations for continuous forests (83%) and less well for sparse forests (72%) and clearings with small trees (70%). Therefore, the approach is suitable for intercepted snow detection over continuous evergreen canopies. This technique provides a new capability for large-scale snow interception model validation and data assimilation to cold regions hydrological forecasting models.},

abstract = {This study investigates the dependence of net radiation at snow surfaces under forest canopies on the overlying canopy density. The daily sum of positive values of net radiation is used as an index of the snowmelt rate. Canopy cover is represented in terms of shortwave transmissivity and sky-view factor. The cases studied are a spruce forest in the Wolf Creek basin, Yukon Territory, Canada, and a pine forest near Fraser, Colorado. Of particular interest are the atmospheric conditions that favor an offset between shortwave energy attenuation and longwave irradiance enhancement by the canopy, such that net radiation does not decrease with increasing forest density. Such an offset is favored in dry climates and at high altitudes, where atmospheric emissivities are low, and in early spring when snow albedos are high and solar elevations are low. For low snow albedos, a steady decrease in snowmelt energy with increasing canopy cover is found, up to a forest density close to the actual densities of mature spruce forests. Snowmelt rates for high albedos are either insensitive or increase with increasing canopy cover. At both sites, foliage area indices close to 2 are associated with a minimum in net radiation, independent of snow albedo or cloud cover. However, these results are more uncertain for open forests because solar heating of trees may invalidate the longwave assumptions, increasing the longwave irradiance.},

The overdeepened Fraser valley was infilled with ice-contact sediments, including terminal and recessional moraines, thereby damming westward drainage and forming Moose Lake. Eastward glacier retreat resulted in the deposition of ice blocks in the shallow west zone of the lake, where subsequent melting disturbed conformable glaciolacustrine deposits. The main Moose Lake basin records a transition from proximal to distal proglacial environments.

As a result, DDS is ideally suited for computationally expensive optimization problems such as distributed watershed model calibration. DDS performance is compared to the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm for multiple optimization test functions as well as real and synthetic SWAT2000 model automatic calibration formulations. Algorithms are compared for optimization problems ranging from 6 to 30 dimensions, and each problem is solved in 1000 to 10,000 total function evaluations per optimization trial. Results are presented so that future modelers can assess algorithm performance at a computational scale relevant to their modeling case study. In all four of the computationally expensive real SWAT2000 calibration formulations considered here (14, 14, 26, and 30 calibration parameters), results show DDS to be more efficient and effective than SCE. In two cases, DDS requires only 15-20% of the number of model evaluations used by SCE in order to find equally good values of the objective function. Overall, the results also show that DDS rapidly converges to good calibration solutions and easily avoids poor local optima. The simplicity of the DDS algorithm allows for easy recoding and subsequent adoption into any watershed modeling application framework. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Algorithms to calculate the threshold wind speed and the effect of exposed vegetation on saltation and to describe vertical profiles of humidity in blowing snow, permit the calculation of point blowing snow transport and sublimation fluxes using standard meteorological and landcover data or simple interfaces with climate models. Blowing snow transport and sublimation fluxes can be upscaled to calculate open environment snow accumulation by accounting for their variability over open snow fields, increase in transport and sublimation with fetch, and the effect of exposed vegetation on partitioning the shear stress available to drive transport. Blowing snow fluxes scaled in this manner were used to calculate snow mass balance and to simulate seasonal snow accumulation at a southern Saskatchewan prairie and an arctic site. Field measurements at these sites indicated that from 48% to 58% of snowfall was removed by blowing snow before melt began. Simulations suggest that the ratios of snow removed and sublimated by blowing snow to that transported were 2∶1 and 1∶1 at the prairie and arctic sites respectively. The resulting methodology was capable of estimating winter season mass balances for these snowpacks that compared well with snowfall and snow accumulation measurements.},

abstract = {Although many studies have investigated the effects of forest cover on streamflow and runoff, and several have examined the effects of canopy density on snowpack accumulation, the impacts of forest canopy density on spatial patterns of snowmelt input to catchments remain relatively underquantified. We performed an intensive snow depth and density survey during maximum accumulation in a mid‐latitude montane environment in northern New Mexico, taking 900 snow depth measurements and excavating six snow pits across a continuum of canopy densities. Snow water equivalent (SWE) data are correlated with forest canopy density (R2 = 0{\textperiodcentered}21, p < 0{\textperiodcentered}0001), with maximum snow accumulation in forests with density between 25 and 40%. Forest edges are shown to be highly influential on patterns of snow depth, with unforested areas shaded by forest to their immediate south holding approximately 25% deeper snow than either large open areas or densely forested areas. This indicates that the combination of canopy influences on throughfall and snowpack shading are key processes underlying snow distribution in the high solar load environments typical of mountainous, mid‐latitude areas. We further show that statistical models of snow distribution are improved with the addition of remotely sensed forest canopy information (R2 increased in 10 of 11 cases, deviance lowered in 9 of 11 cases), making these findings broadly relevant for improving estimation of water resources, predicting the ecohydrological implications of vegetation and climate change, and informing integrated forest and water resources management.

abstract = {The augmented Noah land surface model described in the first part of the two-part series was evaluated here over global river basins. Across various climate zones, global-scale tests can reveal a model's weaknesses and strengths that a local-scale testing cannot. In addition, global-scale tests are more challenging than local- and catchment-scale tests. Given constant model parameters (e. g., runoff parameters) across global river basins, global-scale tests are more stringent. We assessed model performance against various satellite and ground-based observations over global river basins through six experiments that mimic a transition from the original Noah LSM to the fully augmented version. The model shows transitional improvements in modeling runoff, soil moisture, snow, and skin temperature, despite considerable increase in computational time by the fully augmented Noah-MP version compared to the original Noah LSM. The dynamic vegetation model favorably captures seasonal and spatial variability of leaf area index and green vegetation fraction. We also conducted 36 ensemble experiments with 36 combinations of optional schemes for runoff, leaf dynamics, stomatal resistance, and the $\beta$ factor. Runoff schemes play a dominant and different role in controlling soil moisture and its relationship with evapotranspiration compared to ecological processes such as $\beta$ the factor, vegetation dynamics, and stomatal resistance. The 36-member ensemble mean of runoff performs better than any single member over the world's 50 largest river basins, suggesting a great potential of land-based ensemble simulations for climate prediction.

abstract = {The theories of vertical and horizontal subgrade reaction are based on the simplifying assumptions that the subgrade obeys Hooke's law, and that the subgrade reaction on the base of a rigid centrally loaded plate resting on the horizontal surface of the subgrade has the same value at every point of the base. Although these assumptions are not rigorously correct, the theories of subgrade reaction can be used for obtaining approximate solutions of many practical problems, such as the computation of the stresses in continuous footings acted upon by concentrated loads, or in piles that are intended to transfer horizontal load on to the subgrade. However, in order to get reasonably accurate results, the coefficients of subgrade reaction must be assigned values compatible with the deformation characteristics of the subgrade and the dimensions of the loaded area. The Paper contains a discussion of the factors which determine the value of the coefficients of both vertical and horizontal subgrade reaction of cohesionless sand and stiff clay, and numerical values are proposed for the constants which appear in the equations defining these coefficients. It contains also brief reviews of the practical application of the theories of subgrade reaction.

abstract = {The turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapour were studied in a 7.5 ha clearing in Marmot Creek Research Basin, located in the Kananaskis River Basin in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. A locally homogeneous site surrounded by forested mountainous terrain was instrumented allowing 5-level profile measurements of wind speed, temperature, and water vapour, as well as two levels of eddy covariance measurement. Mean profiles exhibit logarithmic distribution with height up to 2.5 m height. The momentum roughness length values, z 0m derived from the eddy covariance measurements were at least an order of magnitude larger than typical values over snow, indicating that the air flow was much more turbulent than would be expected from shear stress developed at the snow surface. Accordingly, the measured wind profile did not match to the expected wind profile using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and first-order closure methods. Despite this discordance, the increased turbulence appears to be well matched to the temperature and water vapour profiles, confirming the measured latent and sensible heat fluxes. Gravimetric evaporation measurements provided further agreement with the latent heat flux measured by the eddy covariance technique. The failure of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory at this site suggests that the application of flux estimation techniques that are based on flux-profile relationships would predict smaller heat flux values than those that were measured.},

abstract = {Sediment has accumulated in Isfjorden, a deep fjord in Spitsbergen, at a rate of ∼ 1.7 km3/k.y. during the past 13 k.y. Between 200 ka and 13 ka the fjord was free of ice for ∼ 120 k.y. Assuming a similar sediment delivery rate during this ice-free time, ∼ 200 km3 of sediment would have accumulated in the fjord. An alternative calculation based on erosion rates suggests that 400 km3 could have been delivered to Isfjorden during this 120 k.y. Seismic studies have identified a ∼ 330 km3 package of sediment on the continental shelf and slope west of Isfjorden. This sediment is believed to have accumulated between 200 ka and 13 ka. Herein we argue that this is sediment that was originally deposited in the fjord, and that it was transferred to the shelf by glaciers in the ∼ 70 ka during which the fjord was occupied by ice. Calculations using a steady-state numerical model suggest that the sediment could have been moved in a deforming layer of subglacial till and in subglacial melt streams at rates of 7.6 × 106 m3 a−1 and 0.3 × 106 m3 a−1, respectively, resulting in a total flux of ∼ 7.9 × 106 m3 a−1. It is unlikely that much sediment was moved in a basal layer of dirty ice, as intense basal melting would have inhibited sediment entrainment. Of the time that glaciers occupied the fjord, ∼ 60% would have been required to evacuate the accumulated sediment. During the remaining time, the ice could have been deepening the fjord.},

abstract = {Climate change poses great risks to western Canada's ecosystem and socioeconomical development. To assess these hydroclimatic risks under high-end emission scenario RCP8.5, this study used the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model at a convection-permitting (CP) 4 km resolution to dynamically downscale the mean projection of a 19-member CMIP5 ensemble by the end of the 21st century. The CP simulations include a retrospective simulation (CTL, 2000-2015) for verification forced by ERA-Interim and a pseudo-global warming (PGW) for climate change projection forced with climate change forcing (2071-2100 to 1976-2005) from CMIP5 ensemble added on ERA-Interim. The retrospective WRF-CTL's surface air temperature simulation was evaluated against Canadian daily analysis ANUSPLIN, showing good agreements in the geographical distribution with cold biases east of the Canadian Rockies, especially in spring. WRF-CTL captures the main pattern of observed precipitation distribution from CaPA and ANUSPLIN but shows a wet bias near the British Columbia coast in winter and over the immediate region on the lee side of the Canadian Rockies. The WRF-PGW simulation shows significant warming relative to CTL, especially over the polar region in the northeast during the cold season, and in daily minimum temperature. Precipitation changes in PGW over CTL vary with the seasons: in spring and late autumn precipitation increases in most areas, whereas in summer in the Saskatchewan River basin and southern Canadian Prairies, the precipitation change is negligible or decreased slightly. With almost no increase in precipitation and much more evapotranspiration in the future, the water availability during the growing season will be challenging for the Canadian Prairies. The WRF-PGW projected warming is less than that by the CMIP5 ensemble in all seasons. The CMIP5 ensemble projects a 10 %-20 % decrease in summer precipitation over the Canadian Prairies and generally agrees with WRF-PGW except for regions with significant terrain. This difference may be due to the much higher resolution of WRF being able to more faithfully represent small-scale summer convection and orographic lifting due to steep terrain. WRF-PGW shows an increase in high-intensity precipitation events and shifts the distribution of precipitation events toward more extremely intensive events in all seasons. Due to this shift in precipitation intensity to the higher end in the PGW simulation, the seemingly moderate increase in the total amount of precipitation in summer east of the Canadian Rockies may underestimate the increase in flooding risk and water shortage for agriculture. The change in the probability distribution of precipitation intensity also calls for innovative bias-correction methods to be developed for the application of the dataset when bias correction is required. High-quality meteorological observation over the region is needed for both forcing high-resolution climate simulation and conducting verification. The high-resolution downscaled climate simulations provide abundant opportunities both for investigating local-scale atmospheric dynamics and for studying climate impacts on hydrology, agriculture, and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Bottom sediments from three lakes in the Canadian Rocky Mountains were examined with the aim of evaluating the usefulness of downvalley sediment studies in reconstruction of Holocene glacial histories. Analyses of organic carbon and carbonate contents of core sediments provide information on changing sedimentation rate and changing relative importance of glacial and non-glacial sediment sources. Sedimentary histories of the three lakes are similar, suggesting that they record regional glacial/climatic forcing, rather than localized events, and thus that they may be useful in reconstructing Holocene glacial history. Lacustrine sediments indicate a period of high sedimentation rates and relatively large glacial sediment contribution prior to 7500-7000 yr B.P., with much reduced rates and decreased glacial sediment contribution between about 6000 and 4000 yr B.P., possibly interrupted by a brief period of increased glacial sediment output shortly after 5000 yr B.P. Sometime after 4000 yr B.P., sedimentation rates and glacial sediment output began to rise again, reaching approximately present levels by 2750-2650 yr B.P., and have not since returned to low mid-Holocene levels. In detail over the last 3000 yr there is some indication of a slight decrease in sedimentation rate for more than 1000 yr after about 2200 yr B.P. Sedimentation rates and glacial sediment input into all three lakes rose between about 900 and 750 yr B.P. and have remained very high since. If the lake sediments are interpreted as a proxy record of upvalley glacial activity, they allow the development of a glacial chronology which is at once generally consistent with, and more complete and easily datable than, the surficial glacial record. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The development of the seasonal snow cover is entirely driven by atmospheric forcing. SNOWPACK uses measured snow depths to determine snow precipitation rates via the calculated settling rates. This requires a rigid data control algorithm. A new statistical model is used to estimate fresh snow density as a function of the measured atmospheric conditions. A statistical model is also derived for the snow albedo, which is necessary to determine the absorbed radiation. The surface sensible and latent heat flux parameterizations are derived from Monin–Obukhov similarity and include a formulation for wind pumping. The formulations will also adapt to drifting snow conditions. The new suggestion is consistent with the observation of different roughness lengths for scalars and momentum over snow. An accurate formulation, especially for the latent heat exchange, is crucial because latent heat exchange determines the formation of surface hoar, a very important weak layer. We also account for the effect of wind pumping on the thermal conductivity in the uppermost snow layers. The surface energy and mass exchange formulations are evaluated by looking at the formation of the important thin layers surface hoar and melt–freeze crusts in SNOWPACK. Those layers are well simulated. In addition, the complete snow profile development is modeled successfully for the parameters grain type, temperature, density, grain size and liquid water content. An overall score between 0 and 1 is used to describe the profile agreement with observations and an average score of over 0.8 is reached.},

abstract = {To determine how elevation affects the sublimation rate from intercepted snow within a subalpine forest canopy, a cut subalpine fir and an artificial conifer were weighed at each of two elevations (3230 and 2920 m) at a U.S. continental site (39°53′N, 105°54′W) from 1 January to 1 May 2001. Measured stand characteristics included canopy density (67% and 75%) and basal area (43.4 and 24.1 m² ha ) for the higher and lower elevations, respectively. Temperature, relative humidity, net radiation, wind speed, and mass of snow on suspended trees provided data to determine whether sublimation rates of intercepted snow are more rapid at higher elevations associated with increased wind speed. Measurements showed the unexpected result that wind speed during sublimation periods was lower at higher elevations, probably because of terrain sheltering. The analysis examined 21 storm-free periods ranging in duration from 9 to 53 h. Sublimation rates per unit mass of intercepted snow were significantly larger at the lower-elevation site associated with warmer temperatures, lower relative humidity, and greater wind speeds. Application of meteorological data to an ice sphere model indicated that predicted mean sublimation rates of an ice sphere index were 23% ± 7% more rapid at the lower elevation due to weather factors alone. However, greater snowfall at higher elevations produced greater interception, resulting in substantially more snow being sublimated back to the atmosphere at the upper site.

abstract = {The sediment budget, which links sediment sources to sediment sinks with hydroclimatic and weathering processes mediating the response, is applied to the analysis of sediments in three alpine lakes in British Columbia. We provide two ways of using the sediment budget as an integrating device in the interpretation of mountain geomorphology. These approaches differ in their resolution and ability to budget the major components of the fine-sediment cascade in glaciated environments. Taken together, they provide an integrated index of landscape change over the Holocene. The first example compares the hydroclimatic controls of lake sedimentation for the last 600 years (A.D. 1370-1998) preserved in varved sediments from two of the lake basins. This hydroclimatological approach incorporates contemporary monitoring, air photo analysis, and detailed stratigraphy of sedimentation events within a single varve to infer the timing, sources, and preferred pathways of fine-grained sediments reaching the lake basins. The results indicate that glaciers, hillslope, and channel instability within the major subbasins are the principal sediment sources to the lake basins. Transitory sediment storage of glacially derived sediments within the channels is believed to modulate the episodic and more frequent delivery of sediments from adjacent hillslope and fluvial storage sites and direct routing of glacial rock flour during years of prolonged glacial melt. The second example, relying on the phosphorus geochemistry of sediments in an alpine lake basin, considers the evolution of phosphorus forms (from mineral to occluded and organic fractions) as a function of the soil development, inherent slope instability, and repeated cycles of glaciation and neoglaciation over the Holocene. This geochemical approach demonstrates that both neoglaciation and full glaciation have essentially zeroed the system in such a way that a high proportion of mineral phosphorus remains in the present lake sediments and the bioavailability of phosphorus (a key to ecosystem development) is low. Both examples illustrate the importance of variable sediment sources; the seasonality, frequency, and magnitude of sediment transfers; and the profound influence of ice cover over contemporary, neoglacial and Pleistocene time scales. They also signal the value of including both clastic and dissolved components in the sediment budget. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The importance of accurately identifying inventories of domestic energy, including forest biomass, has increasingly become a priority of the US government and its citizens as the cost of fossil fuels has risen. It is useful to identify which of these resources can be processed and transported at the lowest cost for both private and public landowners. Accurate spatial inventories of forest biomass can help landowners allocate resources to maximize forest biomass utilization and provide information regarding current forest health (e.g., forest fire potential, insect susceptibility, wildlife habitat range). This research has indicated that hemispherical photography (HP) may be an accurate and low cost sensing technique for forest biomass measurements. In this dissertation: It is shown that HP gap fraction measurements and both above ground biomass and crown biomass have a linear relationship. It is demonstrated that careful manipulation of images improves gap fraction estimates, even under unfavorable atmospheric conditions. It is shown that estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI), based on transformations of gap fraction measurements, are the best estimator for both above ground forest biomass and crown biomass. It is shown that many factors negatively influence the utility of HP for biomass estimation. It is shown that biomass of forests stands with regular spacing is not modeled well using HP. As researchers continue to explore different methods for forest biomass estimation, HP is likely to remain as a viable technique, especially if LAI can be accurately estimated. However, other methods should be compared with HP, particularly for stands where LAI is poorly estimated by HP.},

abstract = {The scenario assumed for this study was that of a region with a complete or first-order weather station surrounded by a network of second-order stations, where only monthly air temperature data were available. The objective was to evaluate procedures to estimate the monthly $\alpha$ parameter of the Priestley-Taylor equation in the second-order stations by adjusting and extrapolating $\alpha$ values determined at the first-order station. These procedures were applied in two climatic zones of north-east Spain with semi-arid continental and semi-arid Mediterranean climates, respectively. Procedure A assumed $\alpha$ to be constant over each zone for each month (direct extrapolation). Procedure B accounted for differences in vapour pressure deficit and available energy for evapotranspiration between the first- and second-order stations. Procedure C was based on equating the Penman-Monteith (P-M) and Priestley-Taylor (P-T) equations on a monthly basis to solve for $\alpha$. Methods to estimate monthly mean vapour pressure deficit, net radiation and wind speed were developed and evaluated. A total of 11 automated first-order weather stations with a minimum period of record of 6 years (ranging from 6 to 10 years) were used for this study. Six of these stations were located in the continental zone and five in the Mediterranean zone. One station in each zone was assumed to be first-order whereas the remainder were taken as second-order stations. Monthly $\alpha$ parameters were calibrated using P-M reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) values, calculated hourly and integrated for monthly periods, which were taken as 'true' values of ETo. For the extrapolation of monthly $\alpha$ parameters, procedure A was found to perform slightly better than procedure B in the Mediterranean zone. The opposite was true in the continental zone. Procedure C had the worst performance owing to the non-linearity of the P-M equation and errors in the estimation of monthly available energy, vapour pressure deficit and wind speed. Procedures A and B are simpler and performed better. Overall, monthly P-T ETo estimates using extrapolated $\alpha$ parameters and Rn - G values were in a reasonable agreement with P-M ETo calculated on an hourly basis and integrated for monthly periods. The methods presented for the spatial extrapolation of monthly available energy, vapour pressure deficit and wind speed from first- to second-order stations could be useful for other applications.

abstract = {In response to ongoing and future-projected global warming, mid-latitude, nival river basins are expected to transition from a snowmelt-dominated flow regime to a nival-pluvial one with an earlier spring freshet of reduced magnitude. There is, however, a rich variation in responses that depends on factors such as the topographic complexity of the basin and the strength of maritime influences. We illustrate the potential effects of a strong maritime influence by studying future changes in cold season flow variability in the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, a large extratropical watershed extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast. We use a process-based hydrological model driven by an ensemble of 21 statistically downscaled simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5).</p> <p>Warming under RCP 8.5 leads to reduced winter snowfall, shortening the average snow accumulation season by about one-third. Despite this, large increases in cold season rainfall lead to unprecedented cold season peak flows and increased overall runoff variability in the VIC simulations. Increased cold season rainfall is shown to be the dominant climatic driver in the Coast Mountains, contributing 60&thinsp;% to mean cold season runoff changes in the 2080s. Cold season runoff at the outlet of the basin increases by 70&thinsp;% by the 2080s, and its interannual variability more than doubles when compared to the 1990s, suggesting substantial challenges for operational flow forecasting in the region. Furthermore, almost half of the basin (45&thinsp;%) transitions from a snow-dominated runoff regime in the 1990s to a primarily rain-dominated regime in the 2080s, according to a snowmelt pulse detection algorithm. While these projections are consistent with the anticipated transition from a nival to a nival-pluvial hydrologic regime, the marked increase in FRB cold season runoff is likely linked to more frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers in the region projected in the CMIP5 models, providing insights for other maritime-influenced extratropical basins.},

Results are given that compare the original and revised forms of TOPMODEL, with and without optimization. One particular feature of this catchment is the availability of measurements of saturated areas. These are taken into account by using a modified distribution of the soil‐topographic index, in a first attempt to relax the assumption of uniform transmissivity in the catchment. It is shown that the reasonably good results obtained with the original model are improved with the revised model, particularly in the simulation of dry weather flows, and that further improvements are obtained with the modified soil‐topographic index distribution.},

abstract = {Physically based equations describing snow interception and sublimation processes were applied to canopy-intercepted snow using a fractal scaling technique to provide a snow-covered forest boundary condition for a one-dimensional land surface scheme. Modification of the land surface scheme's calculation of turbulent transfer and within-canopy ambient humidity was required to accommodate this nested control volume approach. Tests in late winter in a southern boreal forest mature jack pine stand against measured sublimation found that the coupled model provides good approximations of sublimation losses on half-hourly and event bases. Daily sublimation averaged 0{\textperiodcentered}5 kg m-2 daily, with minimum and maximum daily losses of 0{\textperiodcentered}16 and 0{\textperiodcentered}72 kg m-2. Cumulative errors in estimating canopy temperature, humidity and intercepted snow load over 7 days of simulation were -0{\textperiodcentered}7 K, -4{\textperiodcentered}15% of the average observed vapour pressure, and 0{\textperiodcentered}103 kg m-2, respectively. At a nearby regenerating jack pine site, measured peak latent heat ranged from - 14{\textperiodcentered}6 W m-2 to -40{\textperiodcentered}9 W m-2. Testing of the model at this site yielded reasonable estimates of latent and sensible heat fluxes during an overnight event, but did not estimate latent heat flux as well during events involving larger snow loads and incoming solar radiation, possibly as a result of errors introduced by solving for within-canopy humidity and neglect of subcanopy snow energetics. Further work to improve heat storage terms, and the inclusion of subcanopy snow energetics could help improve the coupled model performance. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

Snowfall estimates for weekly, monthly, and seasonal accumulation periods have been compared to measured Nipher-shielded Belfort precipitation gauge quantities. A local scaling issue that caused overestimates is discussed. To enhance the accumulation estimates, the conventional scan radar images were adjusted using the near surface air temperatures.

The resulting in situ or effective particle\r\nsize characteristics of fluvial suspended sediment exert a major control on all processes of entrainment, transport and\r\ndeposition. The significance of composite suspended sediment particles in glacial meltwater streams has, however, not\r\nbeen established. Existing data on the particle size characteristics of suspended sediment in glacial meltwaters relate\r\nto the dispersed mineral fraction (absolute particle size), which, for certain size fractions, may bear little relationship\r\nto the effective or in situ distribution. Existing understanding of composite particle formation within freshwater\r\nenvironments would suggest that in-stream flocculation processes do not take place in glacial meltwater systems\r\nbecause of the absence of organic binding agents. However, we report preliminary scanning electron microscopy data\r\nfor one Alpine and two Himalayan glaciers that show composite particles are present in the suspended sediment\r\nload of the meltwater system. The genesis and structure of these composite particles and their constituent grain size\r\ncharacteristics are discussed.

abstract = {Forest clearings are common features of evergreen forests and produce snowpack accumulation and melt differing from that in adjacent forests and open terrain. This study has investigated the challenges in specifying the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat to snowpacks in forest clearings. The snowpack in two forest clearings in the Canadian Rockies was simulated using a one-dimensional (1D) snowpack model. A trade-off was found between optimizing against measured snow surface temperature or snowmelt when choosing how to specify the turbulent fluxes. Schemes using the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory tended to produce negatively biased surface temperature, while schemes that enhanced turbulent fluxes, to reduce the surface temperature bias, resulted in too much melt. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo experiments showed that no realistic parameter set could successfully remove biases in both surface temperature and melt. A simple scheme that excludes atmospheric stability correction was required to successfully simulate surface temperature under low wind speed conditions. Nonturbulent advective fluxes and/or nonlocal sources of turbulence are thought to account for the maintenance of heat exchange in low-wind conditions. The simulation of snowmelt was improved by allowing enhanced latent heat fluxes during low-wind conditions. Caution is warranted when snowpack models are optimized on surface temperature, as model tuning may compensate for deficiencies in conceptual and numerical models of radiative, conductive, and turbulent heat exchange at the snow surface and within the snowpack. Such model tuning could have large impacts on the melt rate and timing of the snow-free transition in simulations of forest clearings within hydrological and meteorological models.},

Our objective was to determine the optimal values for reliable and stable estimates of LAD profiles from ALS data obtained over a dense tropical forest. Profiles were compared using three methods: Destructive field sampling, Portable Canopy profiling Lidar (PCL) and ALS. Stable LAD profiles from ALS, concordant with the other two analytical methods, were obtained when the grain size was less than 10 m and pulse density was high (> 15 pulses m -2 ). Lower pulse densities also provided stable and reliable LAD profiles when using an appropriate adjustment (coefficient K). We also discuss how LAD profiles might be corrected throughout the landscape when using ALS surveys of lower density, by calibrating with LAI measurements in the field or from PCL. Appropriate choices of grain size, pulse density and K provide reliable estimates of LAD and associated tree plot demography and biomass in dense forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Multidecadal surface temperature changes may be forced by natural as well as anthropogenic factors, or arise unforced from the climate system. Distinguishing these factors is essential for estimating sensitivity to multiple climatic forcings and the amplitude of the unforced variability. Here we present 2,000-year-long global mean temperature reconstructions using seven different statistical methods that draw from a global collection of temperature-sensitive palaeoclimate records. Our reconstructions display synchronous multidecadal temperature fluctuations that are coherent with one another and with fully forced millennial model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 across the Common Era. A substantial portion of pre-industrial (1300–1800 ce) variability at multidecadal timescales is attributed to volcanic aerosol forcing. Reconstructions and simulations qualitatively agree on the amplitude of the unforced global mean multidecadal temperature variability, thereby increasing confidence in future projections of climate change on these timescales. The largest warming trends at timescales of 20 years and longer occur during the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades.},

abstract = {Practical and conceptual questions of micrometeorological flux measurements over inhomogeneous areas are discussed, especially pertaining to the selection and layout of sites and instrumentation in areas that do not comply with generally accepted standards of fetch and homogeneity. Well-known models for footprint or source area analysis are used to evaluate quantitative criteria for the point-to-area representativeness of each component involved in flux measurements. Based on the acceptance or rejection of these criteria, practical recommendations are formulated about the choice of measurement technique and the height range of instrument deployment for a given situation in the field. The scope and scale of the practical recommendations for experimental design that are presented concentrate on two principal measurement scenarios: (1) the measurement of a vertical flux, such as water vapour transport, from a specific crop of limited size; (2) the estimate of spatially representative regional fluxes over agricultural, savannah or urban areas. For both scenarios the optimal selection and layout of measurement sites are examined with respect to the choice of measurement technique: by eddy correlation, the profile technique, or via the energy balance approach. It is argued that it is essentially unimportant what method is used, as long as the overriding principle is observed that the scale of areal representativeness of each component of the measurements be matched to the relevant scale of the flux. To achieve this, it is convenient to define a criterion for the point-to-area representativeness of the measurements involved in the determination of the flux. Three different (but related) versions of representativeness criteria are presented in this paper, which differ by their rigour and the amount of effort required for their application. The most pragmatic version, the source area case examination method, is described in some detail, and its use is demonstrated by examples that show that the suitability of observations for flux evaluations varies greatly between the different measurement techniques in practice today.},

abstract = {Mountain snowpack and spring runoff are key components of surface water resources, and serve as important, regionally integrated indicators of climate variability and change. This study examines whether mountain snowpack and snowmelt have manifested a consistent hydrologic response to global climatic changes over the past several decades. Prior findings are compared to identify spatial and temporal patterns of trends in the volume, extent, and seasonality of snowpack and melt for key mountain regions. Evidence suggests that both temperature and precipitation increases to date have impacted mountain snowpacks simultaneously on the global scale; however, the nature of the impact is, among other factors, strongly dependent on geographic location, latitude, and elevation. Warmer temperatures at mid‐elevations have decreased snowpack and resulted in earlier melt in spite of precipitation increases, while they have not affected high‐elevation regions that remain well below freezing during winter. At high elevations, precipitation increases have resulted in increased snowpack. Not all local responses are consistent with the general findings, possibly because of local climatic trends, atmospheric circulation patterns, record lengths, or data quality issues. With continued warming, increasingly higher elevations are projected to experience declines in snowpack accumulation and melt that can no longer be offset by winter precipitation increases. There is a continued research need for hydroclimatic trend detection and attribution in mountains owing to the length, quality, and sparseness of available data from monitoring stations not directly impacted by human activity.

abstract = {The release of snow in the form of melt water is important to agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, urban water supply, and flood control over a large part of the Northern Hemisphere. One of the factors governing the rate of production of melt water is the energy exchange at the snow surface. The two most important exchange processes are radiation transfer (short‐ and long‐wave) and the turbulent exchange process (sensible and latent heat transfer). The present review considers these two processes exclusively. The radiation exchange is frequently the dominant transfer process during snowmelt on the prairies, in the northern forests, and in mountainous terrain. Methods for modeling radiation on an areal basis during clear days in open areas are well advanced and agreement between calculations and measurements is good although measured data are scarce in the literature. The presence of a forest cover or cloudy skies complicates the modeling process, but relatively simple procedures have been developed in the past few years which are sufficiently accurate for many water management purposes. Sensible and latent heat transfer has been measured at a variety of sites throughout the world. When results are compared it is obvious that such factors as prevailing air mass conditions, altitude, time of year, and terrain features influence the relative importance of turbulent exchange and radiation transfer. As yet there are insufficient data to distinguish trends among these factors with any clarity although the air mass is clearly important and should be considered in future studies of the energy exchange process.},

abstract = {A model including slope effects on snow redistribution, interception and energetics was developed using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model platform, parameterized with minimal calibration and manipulated to simulate the impacts of forest disturbance on mountain hydrology. A total of 40 forest disturbance scenarios were compared with the current land cover for four simulation years. Disturbance scenarios ranged from the impact of pine beetle kill of lodgepole pine to clear-cutting of north- or south-facing slopes, forest fire and salvage logging. Pine beetle impacts were small in all cases with increases in snowmelt volume of less than 10% and streamflow volume of less than 2%. This small impact is attributed to the low and relatively dry elevations of lodgepole pine forests in the basin. Forest disturbances due to fire and clear-cutting affected much larger areas and higher elevations of the basin and were generally more than twice as effective as pine beetle in increasing snowmelt or streamflow. For complete forest cover removal by burning and salvage logging, a 45% increase in snowmelt volume was simulated; however, this only translated into a 5% increase in spring and summer streamflow volume. Forest burning with the retention of standing burned trunks was the most effective forest cover treatment for increasing streamflow (up to 8%) because of its minimizing of winter snow sublimation losses from interception and blowing snow. However, increases in streamflow volumes were almost entirely due to reductions in intercepted snow sublimation with decreasing canopy coverage. Peak daily streamflow discharges responded more strongly to forest cover disturbance than did seasonal streamflow volumes, with increases of almost 25% in peak streamflow from the removal of forest canopy by fire and the retention of standing burned trunks. Peak flow was most effectively increased by forest removal on south-facing slopes and level sites. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.},

abstract = {Proglacial systems are amongst the most rapidly changing landscapes on Earth, as glacier mass loss, permafrost degradation and more episodes of intense rainfall progress with climate change. This review addresses the urgent need to quantitatively define proglacial systems not only in terms of spatial extent but also in terms of functional processes. It firstly provides a critical appraisal of prevailing conceptual models of proglacial systems, and uses this to justify compiling data on rates of landform change in terms of planform, horizontal motion, elevation changes and sediment budgets. These data permit us to produce novel summary conceptual diagrams that consider proglacial landscape evolution in terms of a balance of longitudinal and lateral water and sediment fluxes. Throughout, we give examples of newly emerging datasets and data processing methods because these have the potential to assist with the issues of: (i) a lack of knowledge of proglacial systems within high-mountain, arctic and polar regions, (ii) considerable inter- and intra-catchment variability in the geomorphology and functioning of proglacial systems, (iii) problems with the magnitude of short-term geomorphological changes being at the threshold of detection, (iv) separating short-term variability from longer-term trends, and (v) of the representativeness of plot-scale field measurements for regionalisation and for upscaling. We consider that understanding of future climate change effects on proglacial systems requires holistic process-based modelling to explicitly consider feedbacks and linkages, especially between hillslope and valley-floor components. Such modelling must be informed by a new generation of repeated distributed topographic surveys to detect and quantify short-term geomorphological changes.},

abstract = {Forests cover almost 40% of the seasonally snow‐covered regions in North America. However, operational snow networks are located primarily in forest clearings, and optical remote sensing cannot see through tree canopies to detect forest snowpack. Due to the complex influence of the forest on snowpack duration, ground observations in forests are essential. We therefore consider the effectiveness of different strategies to observe snow‐covered area under forests. At our study location in the Pacific Northwest, we simultaneously deployed fiber‐optic cable, stand‐alone ground temperature sensors, and time‐lapse digital cameras in three diverse forest treatments: control second‐growth forest, thinned forest, and forest gaps (one tree height in diameter). We derived fractional snow‐covered area and snow duration metrics from the colocated instruments to assess optimal spatial resolution and sampling configuration, and snow duration differences between forest treatments. The fiber‐optic cable and the cameras indicated that mean snow duration was 8 days longer in the gap plots than in the control plots (p < 0.001). We conducted Monte Carlo experiments for observing mean snow duration in a 40 m forest plot, and found the 95% confidence interval was ±5 days for 10 m spacing between instruments and ±3 days for 6 m spacing. We further tested the representativeness of sampling one plot per treatment group by observing snow duration across replicated forest plots at the same elevation, and at a set of forest plots 250 m higher. Relative relationships between snow duration in the forest treatments are consistent between replicated plots, elevation, and two winters of data.
Key Points:
Three methods to observe snow‐covered area in forests are compared
Optimal spacing for snow detection with temperature sensors is addressed
Snow persists longer in gaps versus under forest canopies at this study site},

abstract = {The geochemical, mineralogical and lithological composition of modern stream bed material is examined in order to characterize sources and evaluate downstream mixing of sediments in the upper Fraser River drainage basin, British Columbia. The <63 µm fraction is emphasized for its relative mobility and ease of analysis using instrumental neutron activation. Overall, the composition of the stream sediments closely reflects bedrock distribution. Samples dominated by limestone and dolostone, calcite and dolomite, and related elements (Ca, Mg, Sr etc.) correspond to Lower and Middle Cambrian carbonate bedrock largely confined to the Moose River sub-basin. Clastic and non-quartzite metamorphic lithologies, primary and secondary aluminosilicate minerals and related elements (Al, Cs, Rb etc.) are largely derived from Miette Group bedrock and associated with the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Except in the case of the Moose River/Fraser River junction, the determination of proportional tributary contributions is complicated by variable or delayed mixing, localized floodplain or valley side sources, and limited contrast between source areas. At present the Moose River sub-basin contributes a greater proportion of the total and fine-grained sediment loads of the combined Fraser River than would be expected from drainage basin area alone. The imbalance is related to greater relief, precipitation and runoff in the Moose River sub-basin; however, the spatial association of carbonate-rich stream sediments, ice cover and carbonate bedrock exposure indicates that glaciers play a particularly important roll in generating fine-grained fluvial sediment. Since differences in glacier cover and glacier potential in the two major sub-basins are likely to be persistent, and since relative sediment yields from the sub-basins can be determined from sediment composition, a potential indicator of glacier variation and climate change during the Holocene is therein available.},

abstract = {This study assesses a filtering procedure on accumulating precipitation gauge measurements and quantifies the effects of bias corrections for wind-induced undercatch across four ecoclimatic regions in western Canada, including the permafrost regions of the subarctic, the Western Cordillera, the boreal forest, and the prairies. The bias corrections increased monthly precipitation by up to 163 % at windy sites with short vegetation and sometimes modified the seasonal precipitation regime, whereas the increases were less than 13 % at sites shielded by forest. On a yearly basis, the increase of total precipitation ranged from 8 to 20 mm (3-4 %) at sites shielded by vegetation and 60 to 384 mm (about 15-34 %) at open sites. In addition, the bias corrections altered the seasonal precipitation patterns at some windy sites with high snow percentage (> 50 %). This study highlights the need for and importance of precipitation bias corrections at both research sites and operational networks for water balance assessment and the validation of global/regional climate-hydrology models.},

@article{Pomeroy2002,
abstract = {Accumulation of snow under forest canopies is known to decline with increasing canopy density and leaf area because of snow interception and sublimation in the canopy. Seasonal snow accumulation measurements, collected over a decade from various forest stands in western Canada, were used to test and develop methods to relate forest snow accumulation to stand properties and observations of either small-clearing seasonal snow accumulation or seasonal snowfall. At sub-stand scales, the variability of seasonal snow accumulation was not well related to stand leaf area, seasonal interception or small-clearing seasonal snow accumulation. At the stand scale, physically based snow interception equations predicted seasonal snow accumulation from the stand leaf area and the seasonal snow accumulation or snowfall in adjacent clearings. A simple parametric from of these equations showed the sensitivity of seasonal snow accumulation to leaf area at the forest stand scale and suggested a relationship to extrapolate snow accumulation or snowfall measurements from clearings to forest. These relationships, developed from Canadian boreal forest observations, are consistent with Kuz'min's (1960. Formirovanie Snezhnogo Pokrova i Metody Opredeleniya Snegozapasov. Gidrometeoizdat: Leningrad) relationship between accumulation and canopy density derived from Russian observations, suggesting a good degree of transferability.
