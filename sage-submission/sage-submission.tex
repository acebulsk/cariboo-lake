\begin{abstract}
An acoustic record of sedimentation and sediment cores from Cariboo Lake
are analyzed to present a high-resolution record of sediment
accumulation. Acoustically penetrable sediment reaches a maximum
thickness of 35 m in deep parts of the lake, representing deglacial and
Holocene accumulation. A transition from massive to well-layered
sediments is observed in the sub-bottom acoustic record during final
phases of valley deglaciation in the region (ca. 10.5-9 ka BP). Fine
clastic sediments produced from the glaciated headwaters are delivered
by Cariboo River as over-flow currents into the lake which produce
bimodal rhythmic layering of silt and clay sediments. Laminae couplets
are inferred to be deposited annually according to two AMS radiocarbon
dates and a varve counting chronology. Two long cores, 2.9 and 3.8 m in
length, were selected for analysis with estimated basal dates of 2 ka
BP. \textbf{Prominant volcanic reflectors for the region pre-date the
long cores and the chronology is based on two radiocarbon dates and
laminae couplet counting.} The accumulation of sediment into Cariboo
Lake shows above average sediment accumulation rates between 0-700CE and
1500-2017CE which are coincident with cool temperatures and peak glacier
extents. Cariboo Lake is situated in a mountainous region of British
Columbia Canada and is representative of environments transitioning from
semi-arid interior climates to glaciated high mountain regions to the
east. The sediment chronology presented in this study contributes to the
existing body of knowledge of lake sediment accumulation and Holocene
watershed activity for this transitional climate region of western
Canada.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Environmental proxies that extend back beyond the modern observable
record are crucial to understanding earth system processes
\citep{Turney2019, Huber2012, Nelson2016}. Proxy reconstructions at the
sub-annual scale (e.g.~ice cores, tree rings, and corals), to
multi-decadal scales (e.g.~sediments, pollen, boreholes) have proven
useful in describing past environmental conditions across the globe
\citep{Masson2013}. In the case of sedimentary sequences collected from
climate sensitive glaciated watersheds, they have been important in
contributing to the regional understanding of climate and hydrologic
variability over the Holocene. Research by \citet{Neukom2019} have
utilized sedimentary sequences as part of larger paleolimnological
collections to provide global reconstructions of temperature variability
over the last 2000 years. The climatic setting in western Canada over
the Holocene contributed to several fluctuations in glacial activity
with implications for sediment accumulation in glacier-fed lakes.
Analysis of lake sediments from Vancouver Island \citep{Brown2006},
south central British Columbia \citep{Lowe1997} and northern Washington
\citep{Steinman2019} suggest low lake levels and precipitation amounts
during the early Holocene around 11.0 to 7.50 ka. Glacier extents in
western Canada during the early Holocene in the southern Coast Mountains
\citep{Menounos2004, Koch2007a, Osborn2007} and Canadian Rocky Mountain
\citep{Luckman1988, Luckman1988, Luckman1993} have been found to be
reduced relative to the late Holocene. During the Early Neoglacial
(7.50-5.00 ka), glacier advances are primarily reported proximal to the
south Coast Mountains \citep{Osborn2007, Filippelli2006, Ryder1986} with
some limited evidence in the Interior ranges and Rocky Mountains
\citep{Luckman1993}. During the Early-middle Neoglacial (5.00-3.50 ka),
there is widespread evidence of at least two glacial advances across
western Canada from material dated in glacial forefields and clastic
sedimentation
\citep{Koch2007a, Osborn2007, Menounos2008c, Gardner1985, Wood2004, Hodder2006b, Desloges1999, Leonard1999}.
During the Middle-late Neoglacial (3.50-1.00 ka), there is evidence of
at least three glacier advances \citep{Menounos2009b}. In the central
and eastern ranges lacustrine sediment records support extensive glacier
coverage between 3.50-1.85 ka
\citep{Leonard1999, Leonard1997, Dirszowsky1997a, Desloges1999} and from
log and stump material between 2.04-1.32 ka
\citep{Luckman1995, Luckman1999}. The Little Ice Age (LIA) includes
glacier advances over the past millennium and have been reported as
broadly synchronous from Alaska to Patagonia \citep{Luckman2000e}. In
the Canadian Rocky Mountains evidence of glacier advances during the LIA
have been shown centred around CE1850 \citep{Luckman2000e, Leonard1997}
and 1250 \citep{Luckman1995, Osborn2001, Leonard1997}. The coarse
temporal resolution of the above glacier fluctuations are due to dating
uncertainties and may be related to regional climate differences and
sensitivies.

In the western Cordillera of Canada, recovered sedimentary sequences
have been collected in the Coast Mountains \citep{Menounos2008c},
St.~Elias Mountains \citep{Crookshanks2008}, Monashee Mountains
\citep{Hodder2006b}, and Rocky Mountains
\citep{Leonard1986, Dirszowsky1997a, Desloges1999}. A study of Quesnel
Lake (272 km\textsuperscript{2}), 30 km south of the study area examined
here, by \citet{Gilbert2012} found deglacial, and the very earliest
Holocene, sediment infills to be high at around 10.4 ka BP, declining
significantly at around 8.4 ka BP. Trends in Quesnel Lake sediment
characteristics during the Holocene were not detectable as accumulation
rates were very low in the areas of the lake that could be sampled.
Quesnel Lake is very large relative to the contributing watershed and
therefore the sediment system is much less sensitive to climate
variability. To the southeast of Quesnel Lake, and 125 km south of
Cariboo Lake, \citet{Hodder2006b} collected sedimentary sequences from
Mud Lake which showed warmer and drier conditions during the early
Holocene persisted to about 3.6 cal. BP afterwhich sedimeniment
accumulation rates increased with a higher fraction from clastic clay
sediments inferred to be from an increase in glacial activity during the
late Neoglacial. \citet{Desloges1999} collected another sedimentatary
sequence 120 km east of Cariboo Lake, in Mount Robson Provincial Park,
British Columbia which showed a higher fraction of organic and
coarse-grained sand units during the early Holocene starting around 9200
C14 yr BP which is inferred to be due to warm conditions and glacier
retreat. Following this, at approximately 4100 varve years BP, sediment
delivery abruptyl switched to the annual deposition of silt/clay
couplets which are again attributed to Neoglacial ice advances
\citep[e.g.~Peyto Advance,][]{Luckman1995}. In both Mud Lake and Moose
Lake an increase in sediment accumulation is observed around the Little
Ice Age attributed to increasing glacier extents. Additional evidence of
Holocene hydroclimatic variability is provided from other more distal
lakes to the study region presented here.

GAPS - general inconsistency of climate palio lake records and limited
evidence of early neoglacial advance \citet{Menounos2009b}.

\textbf{Previous studies on smaller lakes have had success relating lake
bottom sediment archives (e.g.~varves, grain size and organic content)
to changes in regional temperature, precipitation patterns, and glacier
extent over the Holocene
\citep{Desloges1999, Hodder2006b, Leonard1997, Menounos2006b, Menounos2008c}.
Mountain basins that exhibit a distinct nival hydrographic regime
typically produce distinct varve couplets with a fine-grained layer
deposited in winter when the lake ices over and flow velocity decreases
followed by a coarse-grained layer deposited during spring high flows
\citep[e.g.][]{Leonard1997, Hodder2007c, Desloges1999}. In contrast,
Lakes proximal to the coast of British Columbia typically show a higher
degree noise in their varve record due to the influence of multiple
large fall rain storms (Atmospheric Rivers) that produce multiple coarse
laminations within a single season
\citep[e.g.][]{Gilbert1997, Menounos2008c}. This can result in a much
larger coarse grain fraction compared to the fine grained and may lead
to reduced sensitivity to watershed wide climate and glacial signal.}

\textbf{Lakes that are more distal from glacier activity typically have
relatively lower sediment inputs, due to the upstream filtering of
rivers and/or lakes which limits the coarser fraction of sediment but
still allow some input of the fine fraction \citep{Hodder2007c}. The
effect of this filtering effect on the climate and hydrology signal may
contribute to a weak signal to noise ratio and reduced sensitivity to
hydroclimatic variability if local sediment sources outweigh the
delivery of sediment from headwater sources \citep{Jerolmack2010}.
However, lakes with moderate upstream filtering that maintain a high
fraction of fine clastic sediments produced in the glaciated headwaters
are likely to maintain sensitivity to the hydroclimatic signal of the
basin. Therefore, to determine if Cariboo Lake contains a record of
regional scale climate variability, first the relative role of sediment
inputs must be assessed to determine if sediment delivery is primarily
from local or watershed-wide sources.}

\textbf{Few sedimentary sequences exist in central British Columbia that
provide a high resolution and long term record of hydroclimatic
variability \citep{Gilbert2012, Hodder2006b}. The sedimentary sequence
from Cariboo Lake presented here, fills this gap by providing a new
record of Holocene hydroclimatic variability for the transitionary zone
between the Coastal and Rocky Mountains using lake bottom sediment
records recovered using sub-bottom acoustic methods and long sediments
cores.}

\textbf{Acoustic remote sensing of lake bottom sediments has been used
successfully in many studies to reveal the history of sediment infill
\citep{Desloges1994d, Hodder2006b, Gilbert2012, VanRensbergen1999}.
Acoustic profiles of lake-bottom sediments provide information about
facies in the sediment stratigraphy using variations in sound
propagation \citep{LeBlanc1992}. The acoustic profiles may also provide
coarse resolution (\textasciitilde1000 yr) data regarding differences in
the grain size of sediment \citep[e.g.~strong acoustic reflectors
correlated to an energetic sedimentary environment in][]{Hodder2006b}.}

\textbf{Previous studies have shown difficulty in correlating seasonal
or annual trends in varve thickness, grain size, and organic content
from sediment cores to local discharge, temperature, and precipitation
\citep{Hodder2007c, Menounos2008c, Heideman2017}. \citet{Hodder2007c}
describes the process systems that may influence the variability in
sediment delivery to a lake which include: climate, glacier, fluvial,
geomorphic, terrestrial biologic, and lacustrine systems. As a result of
the complex interactions between these systems the linkage between the
lake sediment signal and climate is typically weak at time scales less
than 10 years \citep{Hodder2007c, Menounos2008c, Heideman2017}. Trends
in lake sediment sequences are typically more representative to climate
fluctuations at longer time scales over over 100 years
\citep{Leonard1999, Osborn2007, Heideman2017}. }

\textbf{The chronology of sedimentary sequences in prior studies are
typically derived from a combination of radiocarbon dating
\citep{Gilbert2012, Hodder2006b, Steinman2019}, identification of
volcanic tephra layers \citep{Gilbert2012, Hodder2006b, Steinman2019}
and counting of visable annual laminations (varves)
\citep{Hodder2006b, Heideman2015}. The Mt. Mazama vocanic eruption is
the most prominent tephra layer typically found in sediment sequences in
western Canada \citep{Gilbert2012, Steinman2019} and has been dated to
roughly to have an age of 7600 cal. BP
\citep{Zdanowicz1999, Hallett1997}. \citet{Westgate1977} reports the
most recent major volcanic ash event to reach central BC occurred 2100
yr BP, predating the basal age of the four sediment cores. Younger
sedimentary sequences, for example the 825 year record collected from
Lillooet Lake, British Columbia, have provided chronologies using a
combination of varve counting and radiocarbon dating in the absence of
discernable tephra layers.}

The purpose of this research is to 1) establish an understanding of the
mechanisms that control the delivery and deposition of the fine sediment
fraction to Cariboo Lake, 2) to reconstruct the highest resolution and
longest term sediment accumulation record possible for this area of
British Columbia, 3) compare and contrast the accumulation record in
this transitional (semi-arid to glaciated mountainous) lake system with
existing sedimentary sequences and regional climate proxies in western
Canada.

\section{Study Area}\label{study-area}}

Cariboo Lake is located in the northern foothills of the Columbia
Mountains, 85 km northeast of Williams Lake, British Columbia (Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}). The lake receives runoff from an area of 3244
km\textsuperscript{2}, which is filtered by three deep fjord like lakes
Issac Lake, Lanezi Lake, and Ghost Lake shown in Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}. The watershed relief ranges from 2600 m asl. in the
eastern headwaters to 600 m asl. at the western Cariboo Lake outlet. The
west to east, 90 km long watershed spans climate ranging from 1370 mm/yr
in the headwaters to 477 mm/yr at the semi-arid outlet to the lake. The
area of Cariboo Lake is 10 km\textsuperscript{2} resulting in a lake
area-to-watershed area ratio of 0.3\%. The Cariboo Lake watershed has 64
km\textsuperscript{2} of permanent ice cover which covers 2\% of the
total watershed \citep{Bolch2008}. The most extensive glaciated terrain
is proximal to Mt. Lunn roughly 60 km upstream of Cariboo Lake (Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}).

The Cariboo River, draining into the east margin of the lake, is the
main source of sediment. The lake is separated into two basins, by a
large alluvial ban building cross-valley from Keithley Creek (Figure
\ref{fig:map-lake}). The upstream basin is 8 km\textsuperscript{2} and
is referred to here as the main Cariboo Lake basin. The downstream
basin, referred to here as the Keithley Creek sub-basin, is 2
km\textsuperscript{2}. The bathymetry of the lake reaches a maximum
depth of over 50 m in two deep holes within the central part of the main
Cariboo Lake basin. These deep holes provide some evidence of past
glacial scouring.

\end{figure}

Sediment connectivity to headwater glaciers along the Cariboo River is
limited due to lake filtering by Lanezi and Sandy lake (Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}). Lanezi Lake is a deep fjord-like lake with a
bathymetry reaching a maximum depth of 170 m. Sandy Lake is much
shallower reaching a maximum depth of 6 m. The Matthews River, which
meets the Cariboo River just below Lanezi Lake provides a less filtered
connection to meltwater sources draining several alpine glaciers
including the largest area of ice (10 km\textsuperscript{2}) in the
Cariboo Lake watershed, proximal to Roberts Peak (Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}).

\subsection{Field Methods}\label{field-methods}}

A field campaign was conducted during the summer of 2017 to collect
sub-bottom acoustic soundings, dredge samples, and sediment cores.
Thirty-four km of sub-bottom acoustic soundings were collected across
Cariboo Lake using a 10 kHz StrataBox 3510 HD. An Ekman dredge was used
to collect 20 samples from the lake bottom, each yielding
\textasciitilde730 cm\textsuperscript{3} of surficial sediment. The
dredge samples were sub-sampled in the field using an 80 mm diameter PVC
cylinder pushed into the block of sediment. This resulted in 20 short
cores each containing about 450 cm\textsuperscript{3} of sediment. The
remaining sediment not captured in the PVC cylinder was kept as a bulk
sediment sample. Four long sediment cores (V1-V4) were collected using a
Rossfelder submersible vibracorer with a 6 m long 70 mm diameter
aluminum pipe. The Ekman short cores and the long vibracores were split
longitudinally with one half preserved as an archive and the other as a
working half. The working half samples were prepared for imaging by
scraping the core parallel to the sediment laminae to create a flat
surface which showed the sediment stratigraphy. The stratigraphy of long
cores V1 and V2 were best preserved and were selected for detailed
analysis.

\hypertarget{laboratory-methods}{%
\subsection{Laboratory Methods}\label{laboratory-methods}}

The cores and short cores were analyzed for laminae thickness, organic
content, and particle size. Long cores V1 and V2 were subsampled with 2
cm\textsuperscript{3} of sediment extracted at a 5 cm interval, with
additional samples taken within stratigraphic breaks. Laminae couplets
observed on the working cores were digitally counted and measured for
thickness using the ImageJ software, by \citet{Schneider2012}. Organic
content was determined by loss-on-ignition analysis (550 °C) following
methods in \citet{Smith2003}. Samples were first weighed to provide an
initial wet weight, then dried at 60 °C and weighed again after oven
drying. The samples were then placed in a furnace at 550 °C for 2.5
hours and weighed a third time. Grain size analysis was conducted using
a Mastersizer Particle Size Analyzer 3000. Samples were prepared
following methods by \citet{Gray2010} to remove the fine fraction of
particles from organic material. This involved a removal of organic
material using three sequential alloquots of 20\%
H\textsubscript{2}0\textsubscript{2} until the sample stopped reacting.
To prevent flocculation of sediment grains the samples were dispersed in
0.05\% solution of Calgon for 24 hours. Grain size was measured three
times for each sample, resulting in an average standard deviation of +/-
0.01 µm. The chronology of both vibra cores was reconstructed using AMS
\textsuperscript{14}C dating of three wood fragments (analyzed at the
André E. Lalonde AMS Laboratory at the University of Ottawa) and a
chronology derived from laminae (couplet) counting on working core
images.

\subsection{Sub-bottom Acoustics}\label{sub-bottom-acoustics}}

Acoustic stratigraphy from six selected transects (see locations in
Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}) reveal the range of morphologies and
character of sedimentary deposits in Cariboo Lake (Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}). Acoustic penetration is limited in transects A and
E by coarser sediments proximal to river fan-deltas across Cariboo Lake
(see triangle symbols in Figure \ref{fig:map-lake} for fan-delta
locations). Acoustic signal penetration, resolution and distinctive
acoustic layering improves significantly along the thalweg of the lake
bottom away from the main Cariboo River delta and in cross-lake
transects more distal from the valley-side fan-deltas. Cross-hatching is
observed over most of the acoustic record due to errant electrical
interference from the research vessel that could not be resolved.
However, the interference does not affect the overall quality of the
acoustic results in the six selected transects (Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}, A-F).

Transect A, one kilometer southwest of the headwater Cariboo River
delta, has a strong acoustic reflector at the sediment-water interface
indicating the presence of coarser-grained material on the lakebed
(Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, A). Grab samples on this transect show a
high fraction of sandy materials which act as an acoustic mask limiting
the penetration of the acoustic signal to a depth of 1-2 m. An acoustic
multiple (echo) is observed 45 m below the sediment surface caused by
the limited penetration at the surface (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, A -
i).

Acoustically penetrable, well-layered sediment is observed 3.5 km from
the Cariboo River delta in transect B (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, B).
This site is proximal to long core V1. Acoustic reflectors with 1-2 m
separation lie conformably over a hummocky basement which is observed on
the south side of the transect (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, B - i). The
acoustic basement drops off below the observable record near the south
channel-like depression. Well structured layering extends across the
south side of the transect but pinches out towards the north shore
(Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, B, C \& D). On the south side of the
transect, the thickness of the well structured layering ranges from 10
to 20 m. Underlying the layered sediments is a more massively layered
facies which ranges from 12 to 25 m thick before the record is cut off.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/acoustics_6_panel}

\end{figure}

Acoustic penetration increases 4.5 km from the Cariboo River delta at
transect C (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C). The acoustic record along
this transect reaches a maximum sediment thickness of 35 m in two
troughs, the maximum thickness of surficial sediments observed across
Cariboo Lake in this study. The acoustic basement is considered to be
either bedrock or coarse-grained glacial sediment from the Last Glacial
Maximum (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C -- i). Two sediment facies are
observed across this transect based on geometry and the strength and
continuity of reflectors. Some disruption of these facies is caused by
slumping of side slopes (e.g.~north end of transect C). The lower unit,
facies A, has a thickness of \textasciitilde{} 12 m along undisturbed
sections (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C) and is more massive to weakly
acoustically layered. The contact with overlying sediment above facies A
appears to be conformable at the south end and middle of the transect
but unconformable in other places. The unconformities are most apparent
in the two sharp crested v-notch channels at the middle of the transect.
These channels are a continuation of those noted in transect B. These
are inferred to be scour channels formed by erosive, higher energy,
turbidity currents that probably date to deglaciation of the lake basin.
The lack of numerous layers and generally lighter grey tone in facies A
indicates a somewhat higher energy and more rapid deposition of coarser
lacustrine sediment. Facies B begins with high-amplitude parallel
reflectors with 2-3 m separation and conforms well with facies A below
(Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C). Facies B has a thickness of
\textasciitilde{} 10 m along undisturbed sections and deepens to a
maximum of 13 m within the scour channels (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C
- ii \& iii). The strength of reflectors in facies B are stronger and
more numerous than those in facies A indicating more frequent events of
lower overall magnitude during this time. The strength of reflectors
gradually decreases moving upwards and spacing thins to sub metre
thickness near the surface. The gradual decrease in reflectance is
interrupted by a strong reflector at the top of facies B along the
sediment-water interface. The two buried troughs in transect C (Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}, C - ii, iii) are significant and best expressed in
this area of the lake. The north trough (ii) appears to be a depression
that was continuously infilled by facies A and then B. Hence it most
likely represents an older pre-existing feature. The sediments in the
southern trough (iii) are interesting in that a wedge of sediment infill
seems to be an unconformable deposit with both facies B below and facies
A above. It is likely that an erosional channel developed after or in
the later stages of facies A deposition which infilled the wedge.
Sedimentation of the wedge was then truncated by the onset of the facies
B sediment. While the two troughs might have been active at the same
time during deglaciation, only the southern trough was reactivated at a
later time and infilled with sediment prior to the onset of facies B
deposition.

Transect D, to the northeast of the Frank Creek delta has well-layered
sediments in the top 5-10 m and transitions to poor acoustic penetration
below this (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, D). The parallel reflectors
observed in the uppermost sediment layers of transect D have a thickness
of 2-3 m and have a higher amplitude compared to facies B in transect C.
Some slumping of sidewall sediments is observed on the south sidewall
(Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, D).

Southwest of the Frank Creek fan-delta, acoustic reflectors along
transect E show a decline in reflectance and a decrease in layer
thickness to \textless{} 1 m. Acoustic masking from coarse grained
sediment occurs at depths of 2-4 m along the south margin (Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}, E). Total sediment thickness of finer, acoustically
well-layered material along the north bench is significant approaching
10 m. The sedimentary environment southwest of the Frank Creek delta is
different to transects northeast of the delta. The profile suggests that
much of the suspended sediment transported from the upper lake does not
make it past the shallow lake depths (\textless{} 20 m) of the sill at
the Frank Creek fan-delta apart from the northern most part of the
transect. So, coarser sediment from the Frank Creek fan-delta dominates
the south side of the transect and fine sediment deposition is
restricted, or forced, to the north side. The Coriolis effect may
enhance this as suspended sediments are deflected to the right as they
enter Cariboo Lake from Frank Creek.

Similar to the Frank Creek fan-delta, the very shallow sill of less than
2 m opposite the Keithley Creek prograding fan-delta significantly
reduces sediment connectivity to the main Cariboo Lake basin (see
triangle proximal to Keithley Creek in Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}).
Transect F, located close to the centre of the Keithley Creek sub-basin
shows a maximum observable sediment thickness of 4 m concentrated in the
basin thalweg (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}). Below this there is acoustic
masking by coarser sediment. The acoustic reflectors within the top 4 m
of transect F are acoustically penetrable, well layered and are
conformable to the basin morphology. These reflectors are of higher
amplitude compared to those in transect E and are thicker at 1-2 m. This
suggests that significant amounts of coarse-grained sediments are found
in this part of the lake, likely originating from the high energy
Keithley Creek drainage basin. Fine faction sediments from the main
Cariboo Lake are expected to make up a small percentage as transport
into this sub-basin is limited by up-lake storage, filtering and
hypopycnal overpassing.

\hypertarget{spatial-trends-in-surficial-sediment}{%
\subsection{Spatial Trends in Surficial
Sediment}\label{spatial-trends-in-surficial-sediment}}

Twenty surficial sediment cores ranging from 6-12 cm thick were analyzed
for grain size, laminae thickness, and organic content. These samples
were collected following a longitudinal transect down Cariboo Lake and
indicate how sediment flux varies with distance from the Cariboo River
delta (see Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}, for sampling locations). The
D\textsubscript{50} grain size follows a steep decline from 89.9 µm, 300
m from the delta, to 31.3 µm 550 m from the Cariboo River delta (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, A). The decline in D\textsubscript{90} grain size
follows a more pronounced decline, while the D\textsubscript{10} remains
largely unchanged. This suggests that larger sand-sized sediments are
sensitive to distance from fan deltas, while smaller silt- and
clay-sized sediments are less sensitive. The decrease in
D\textsubscript{50} and D\textsubscript{90} grain size generally
continues further down-lake with the exception of samples proximal to
valley-side fan-deltas. A small increase in D\textsubscript{50} is
observed proximal to the Pine Creek fan-delta from a low of 21.5 µm at
1.1 km and up to 28.2 µm 1.83 km from the main Cariboo River delta
(Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, A). At distances greater than 2 km from the
Cariboo River delta the fraction of silt-sized sediments remains at over
80 \%, aside from core E16 which is near the Frank Creek fan-delta.
Proximal to the Frank Creek fan-delta the D\textsubscript{50} grain size
nearly doubles in size from 7.92 µm at 6.4 km to 15.1 µm at 7.35 km from
the Cariboo River delta. In the Keithley Creek sub-basin the
D\textsubscript{50} grain size has an average grain size of 15.9 µm (n =
3) and the composition of sediment is 4.0\% clay, 85.8\% silt, and
10.2\% sand (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, A).

Proximal to the Cariboo River delta (\textless{} 500 m) the structure of
the surficial sediments exhibits massive layering, erosive contacts and
the fraction of sand grains in these samples is greater than 60\%. A
sand-bed with a thickness of 1 cm is observed in the bulk sample closest
to the Cariboo River delta (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, A). In the main
Cariboo River basin, the most well-preserved core (E13) was taken 5.24
km from the Cariboo River delta, proximal to long core V2, in the
deepest part at a depth of 40 m. Sediment here shows rhythmic lamination
(Figure \ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, B).

C (E18) was retrieved from the Keithley Creek sub-basin (29.53 km down lake).}\label{fig:ekmanImgs}
\end{figure}

Sediment cores E9-E15 and E18-E20, retrieved from areas in Cariboo Lake
that are distal from river deltas and have lake depths of 30-50 m, have
a high fraction of silt and clay sediment and exhibit a sequence of
fine-grained dark layers followed by coarse-grained light layers (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, B \& C). The thickness of sediment laminae couplets
within these surface cores demonstrate a gradual decreasing trend with
distance down-lake from the Cariboo River delta (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, B). Maximum couplet thickness has an average of 4.7
mm (n = 6) in the Cariboo River basin and 7.9 mm (n = 3) in the Keithley
Creek sub-basin. In the Cariboo River basin, maximum couplet thickness
decreases by 0.62 mm/km and by 2.17 mm/km in the Keithley Creek
sub-basin with distance down-lake (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, B). This
decrease in couplet thickness with distance from the main contributing
delta's is attributed to the Cariboo River being the main source of
sediment into Cariboo Lake as sediment flux typically declines with
distance from the primary sediment source. The decline in thickness is
more rapid in the Keithley Creek sub-basin is likely due to additional
local inputs of coarser grained sediment coming from the Keithley Creek
tributary.

Trends in percent organic matter (OM) of surficial sediment cores were
not found to exhibit systematic patterns with distance down-lake (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, C). The lowest OM values were observed in the
Keithley Creek sub-basin which suggest higher levels of clastic sediment
yield in this basin.

The results from particle size, laminae thickness, and percent organics
suggest that sediment delivered from the main Cariboo River is the
primary source of sediment to Cariboo Lake. Massive layering of sediment
and coarse-grained particle sizes are limited to areas proximal to Pine
Creek, Frank Creek and Keithley Creek deltas where localized turbidity
currents are active. Outside of these areas, where turbidity currents
and bedload transport processes are reduced, the sediment in Cariboo
Lake is largely comprised of rhythmically laminated silt and clay
sediments likely transported primarily through suspended sediment
processes from the main Cariboo River. In the Keithley Creek sub-basin
grain size and laminae structures are larger in size than those observed
in the main Cariboo River basin suggesting local sediment inputs from
the Keithley Creek are significant (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, C).

\hypertarget{sediment-accumulation-chronology}{%
\subsection{Sediment Accumulation
Chronology}\label{sediment-accumulation-chronology}}

Four vibra sediment cores, ranging from 2 -- 4 m in length, were
retrieved from the deepest portions of Cariboo Lake (Figure
\ref{fig:map-lake}). Cores V1 (2.9 m) and V2 (3.8 m) in the main Cariboo
River basin were selected for detailed analysis as these two cores had
organic material for AMS radiocarbon dating, and their sedimentary
record was well preserved. The chronology of the two cores is provided
by a small number of AMS radiocarbon dates and laminae counting. No
evidence of volcanic tephra was found within either of the two cores
through visual color changes. \textbf{Since the most prominent ash
deposits observed in western Canada predate the basal age of the two
cores \citep{Westgate1977, Hallett1997}, smaller tephra layers within
the core were not as easy to identify}. This combined with the dark
colour of the clastic core sediments prevented finding smaller volcanic
ash events within the cores. Records of grain size, varve thickness, and
organic content from these two cores demonstrate patterns in sediment
delivery to Cariboo Lake over the past 2000 years.

\hypertarget{chronology}{%
\subsubsection{Chronology}\label{chronology}}

Organic material for dating in the clastic dominated cores was extremely
limited. AMS radiocarbon dates obtained for cores V1 and V2 provide
limited temporal control and evidence of sediment accumulation rates. A
small twig from V1 at 347 cm yielded a date of 1899-1819 cal BP. Two
separate samples were analyzed from V2, one comprised of a large twig at
222 cm yielding a date of 490-316 cal BP (V2a), and a combination of two
separate organic pieces which were combined into one sample, a twig at
286 cm and a pine needle at 294 cm, providing a date of 2045-1895 cal BP
(V2b). Figure \ref{fig:amsRates} shows the dating calibration curves
derived for the three AMS radiocarbon dates and accumulation rates from
couplet thickness counting of Ekman surficial cores 13-15. The dates
from samples V1 and V2b yield consistent accumulation rates of 1.87 +/-
0.04 mm/yr and 1.47 +/- 0.11 mm/yr respectively. AMS sample V2a yields
an accumulation rate of 5.51 mm/yr inconsistent with the rates provided
for V1 and V2b.

Ekman surficial cores 13-15, shown in Figure \ref{fig:amsRates}, are
proximal to the V2 long core (see Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}). The
light-dark couplets in the short cores are identical to annual deposits
noted in dozens of other lakes throughout BC \citep[e.g.][]{Hodder2007}
so it is assumed that they closely approximate varves, in which case
they exhibit accumulation rates of 2.24, 2.52, and 2.31 mm/yr
respectively. Higher accumulation rates are expected for the Ekman
samples as they are not subjected to the same level of compaction as is
deeper sediment in the long cores. The consistency of the E13-E15
inferred accumulation rates when compared with two of the AMS dates from
the V1 and V2b cores (Figure \ref{fig:amsRates}) are additional
compelling evidence of the varved nature of the sediment record. This
consistency also suggests that the V2a AMS sample is suspect for
temporal control. In viewing the V2a sample orientation and position
along the outer core it is speculated that the sample may have been
pulled down during the coring process due to the large twig size at
about 4 cm. This probably results in the erroneously high accumulation
rate for V2a.

Accumulation rates in areas proximal to river inputs in nearby Quesnel
Lake were measured to be about 0.72 mm/a (see Figure 9 in Gilbert and
Desloges, 2012). Sediment inputs are expected to be lower in Quesnel
Lake compared to Cariboo Lake, with more arid and less glaciated
portions of the Quesnel Lake watershed contributing to that lower rate.
Accumulation rates of 1.47 to 1.87 mm are consistent for a smaller
Cariboo Lake watershed with a higher fraction of glacier cover. Laminae
couplet thickness in Ekmans and two of the three vibra core AMS dates do
not support the V2a accumulation rate of 5.51 mm/yr and therefore it was
not included in subsequent analysis. The AMS radiocarbon dates from
samples V1 and V2b provide an important control when interpreting the
inferred temporal pattern of sediment inputs to Cariboo Lake. The top
section of cores V1 and V2 were disturbed during coring - 110 mm for V1
and 70 mm for V2. While the Ekman cores were too short to overlap with
the undisturbed sections of the vibra cores, laminae thickness
similarities shown in Figure \ref{fig:amsRates}, allow anchoring the top
of core dates to 0/0 (depth/date).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/sed_rates_V1_V2_ekmans} 

}

\caption{Cumulative accumulation rates for cores V1 and V2 using AMS dates V1, V2a and V2b and extrapolation of observed Ekman surficial core couplet thicknesses in E13, E14, and E15 all three of which are proximal to V2.\label{fig:amsRates}}\label{fig:amsRates}
\end{figure}

Three distinct sediment facies were observed in both V1 and V2:
discernible couplets, indiscernible couplets (disturbed facies) and
graded turbidite events. The similarity in couplet structure and
thickness between cores V1 and V2 strongly suggested these are varves.
This interpretation is supported by the two valid AMS radiocarbon dated
samples from cores V1 and V2 which corresponded reasonably well with the
couplet count chronology at the same depth. A small difference between
the two chronologies is present due to some isolated disturbed sections
of core, core compaction, undercounting, and subjectivity in classifying
the occasionally thicker (4 to 47 mm thick) graded to massive
laminae/beds.

Laminae/beds with D\textsubscript{50} grain size greater than 3 standard
deviations from the mean were classified as event-based turbidite beds.
Laminae with thickness greater than 6 standard deviations for V1 and 2
standard deviations for V2 from the mean were classified as event-based
turbidite beds. Figure \ref{fig:varve-turb} examples show the difference
in regular laminae compared to an event-based turbidite bed. Turbidite
beds observed in V1 and V2 were well defined and graded (see Figure
\ref{fig:varve-turb}, d). These turbidite beds are similar in structure
to those described in \citet{sabatier2022} as originating from a flood,
glacial lake outburst flood, or delta collapse event. Since the Cariboo
River upstream of Cariboo Lake is filtered by headwater proglacial
lakes, it is more likely the turbidite beds at the distal V1 and V2 site
are from localized sidewall tributary floods. Collapse of the foreslope
of an oversteppened Cariboo delta is also possible.

Where possible the thickness, grain size statistics, and percent organic
matter (OM) were analyzed for each event layer. The turbidite bed grain
size, OM, and thickness shown in Table 1 illustrate the high sediment
flux during these events compared to the regular, annually occurring
couplets. The composition of sediment grains within the event-based
layers were all characterized by a coarser single mode with less than
0.01\% clay, over 98\% silt and less than 1\% sand. The grain size
distribution for the regular couplet sediments is characterized by a
bi-modal distribution with an average composition of 16\% clay, 83\%
silt, and less than 1\% sand. Figure \ref{fig:turbScatter} shows that
some event layers are coincident in time between V1 and V2. Since each
of the event-based layers contain sediment deposited over a single,
potentially localized event, they were removed from subsequent trend
analyses of varve thickness, grain size, and percent organics. After
removal, the long core sediment records are thought to be most
representative of watershed wide trends in river discharge influenced by
temperature and precipitation rather than isolated events and inputs
from nearby tributaries and hillslopes.

\end{figure}

The varve-based chronology is based on the counting of discernible
couplets with graded turbidite facies removed. The absence of laminae
couplets in the disturbed-massive units makes interpreting the time
elapsed over each of these units difficult (see Figure
\ref{fig:varve-turb} C). To compensate for the depth intervals
associated with the disturbed sections, a 30-year moving average of
sediment accumulation rates from immediately above and below the
disturbed sections were used to interpolate accumulation rates over each
facies (see method described in Menounos et al., 2008). For core V1,
laminae couplets were counted down to a core depth of 347 cm, where the
AMS radiocarbon organic material was retrieved. This resulted in a V1
couplet-derived age estimated of 1450 BP compared to the AMS radiocarbon
estimate of 1899 - 1819 cal BP. For core V2 a date of 1886 BP was
estimated by couplet counting down to a core depth of 294 cm which
matches more closely with the V2b AMS radiocarbon date of 2045-1895 cal
BP. The better alignment between the couplet counting age and the AMS
derived age in V2 can be attributed to the higher degree of core
disturbance in V1 compared to V2. Disturbed sections that had
indiscernible couplets may have resulted in the undercounting within
core V1. Still, based on the relatively close agreement between the AMS
radiocarbon dated organic material and couplet counting, laminae
couplets in V1 and V2 are considered to be deposited annually. Close
alignment was not expected due to the aforementioned errors present in
the couplet counting methodology and the limited 14C dates available.

The basal age for each core is estimated using both the varve chronology
and the AMS radiocarbon accumulation rate. The basal age of V1 at a
depth of 382 cm is approximately 1620 BP based on the varve chronology
and 2046 cal BP based on the extrapolated 14C date. The basal age of V2
at a depth of 291 cm is about 1910 BP based on the varve chronology and
2007 cal BP by extrapolating the 14C. Accumulation rates estimated using
the varve counting chronology and the AMS radiocarbon date chronology
had a larger difference at V1 with 2.4 mm/yr and 1.87 +/- 0.04 mm/yr,
respectively. Closer agreement was observed at V2 with 1.52 mm/yr
estimated using the couplet counting method and 1.47 +/- 0.11 mm/yr from
the AMS radiocarbon date. While V2 is likely the better predictor of
changes in accumulation rates over the last 2000 years, we believe both
cores are valid estimates of late Holocence sediment accumulation
patterns in Cariboo Lake.

\hypertarget{sediment-accumulation-chronology-and-statistics}{%
\subsubsection{Sediment Accumulation Chronology and
Statistics}\label{sediment-accumulation-chronology-and-statistics}}

For the laminae couplet time series, shown in Figure \ref{fig:varves-a},
only the discernible couplets are analyzed, event-based turbidites have
been removed and disturbed facies are represented as gaps. The
chronologies for this time series were derived using a linear
interpolation from the AMS radiocarbon dates. The mean varve thickness
for V1 is 2.4 mm and for V2 is 1.5 mm. Thicker varves are expected at V1
due to its closer proximity to the Cariboo River delta. This is also
supported by the thicker varves observed in core E11 (proximal to V1)
compared to E13 (proximal to V2) of 2.8 mm to 2.0 mm respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:varves-a} shows the time series of varve thickness
measured from V1 and V2 and illustrates trends in suspended sediment
delivery to Cariboo Lake. The measured couplet thicknesses in the two
cores are plotted as standardized departures to facilitate comparison
between the two cores. In each plot a 30-year moving average with a
1-year time step is plotted in black to emphasize decadal to centennial
patterns in accumulation rate departures. The 30-year average varve
thickness remains above average from 0 to 750 CE, for both V1 and V2,
with a stronger signal observed for V1 which is closer to the main
Cariboo River outlet. Below average varve thickness is observed at both
V1 and V2 from 750-1600 CE. After 1600 CE, trends in varve thickness
between the two cores depart, with V2 above average during the Little
Ice Age and V1 remains below average. Sub-centennial trends are not
reported due to the coarse temporal control for both V1 and V2.

\hypertarget{grain-size}{%
\paragraph{Grain Size}\label{grain-size}}

The mean D\textsubscript{50} grain size at V1 is 7.6 +/- 0.01 µm
compared to 6.3 +/- 0.01 µm at V2. The larger grain size and varve
thickness at V1 compared to V2 is consistent with the spatial trends in
sediment delivery observed from the Ekman cores. While based on a
limited number of measurements compared to the varve thickness analysis,
the temporal pattern in standardized departures of D\textsubscript{50}
grain size between the two cores shows a consistent pattern (Figure
\ref{fig:particle}). Both V1 and V2 have above average grain size
between 0 to 700 CE and below average from 700 to 1500 CE. After 1500
CE, grain size follows an increasing trend with average to above average
grain size. V1 shows a more dramatic increase in grain size compared to
V2. While couplet thickness does not increase substantially over the LIA
interval, gain size does. Overall, grain size fluctuations at a temporal
resolution of about 100-years shows good correspondence between the two
cores over the last 2000 years.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{organic-matter}{%
\paragraph{Organic Matter}\label{organic-matter}}

The whole core average OM content at V1 and V2 is similar at 4.76\% and
4.80\%, respectively, suggesting that the flux of allochthonous organic
material to the core locations is not dependent on distance from the
main Cariboo River as it is easily transported through the lake due to
low density. This is also supported by the Ekman OM spatial analysis,
where a systematic down-lake relationship was not observed (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, C). Figure \ref{fig:loi} shows the percent organic
matter (OM) for both V1 and V2. Higher levels of organic content are
shown in V1 and V2 from 0-1000 CE and mostly below average from
1000-2000 CE. Specific periods of above average OM for V1 occur around
CE 50-500, 650-1150, around 1300 and 1750-1850. OM in V2 matches above
average values in the interval CE 250-550 and 650-950. During the last
100 years both cores show a persistent decline in OM which could be
attributed to a relative increase in sediment delivery to Cariboo Lake
suggested by the increase in D\textsubscript{50} and varve thickness. As
glaciers declined from peak LIA extents around 1750 CE, an increase in
vegetation growth is expected which may also contribute to a decline in
OM as organic content is locked up as needleleaf coniferous forest.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Cariboo Lake was selected to test the utility of moderate sized
glacier-fed lakes as archives of accessible long-term and
high-resolution sedimentation input variability. Evidence of late
Pleistocene deglaciation in the Cariboo Lake region is provided by
coarse temporal resolution sub-bottom acoustic results. A maximum
deglacial sediment thickness of \textasciitilde35 m puts Cariboo Lake in
the middle to lower range of Holocene sediment inputs in Canadian
Cordilleran lakes \citep[see detailed discussion in][]{Gilbert2012}. The
study of smaller Mud Lake, in the Rocky Mountains to the east of Cariboo
Lake (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin} -- inset) was evaluated by
\citet{Hodder2006b}, who found the early phases of deglaciation and lake
sediment infill started just prior to 9.6 ka BP. \citet{Gilbert2012}
indicate deglaciation of the north and west arms of nearby Quesnel Lake
was likely complete by 8.6 ka BP. \citet{Menounos2009b} pointed to the
deglaciation of most of the Cordilleran ice sheet before 10.5 ka BP. The
Cariboo Lake acoustic results contribute to this regional record however
the inferred bottom dates present uncertainty in the actual timing.

Unlike many other deglacial sediment packages in Canadian Cordilleran
lakes, the sediment infill in Cariboo Lake has been subject to deep
trenching during deglaciation and the early Holocene (Figure 3c). The
troughs, with sediment infills occurring at different times, suggest the
presence of highly erosive but intermittent bottom currents during
deglaciation and into the very earliest Holocene. Energetic flow of cold
sediment-rich meltwater flow would be required suggesting proximity of
an actively retreating valley glacier. The absence of lower elevations
moraines in the valley upstream of Cariboo Lake might indicate rapidly
retreating ice into headwater locations. However, in general, moraines
indicative of stagnant ice fronts in lower elevation settings are not
common elsewhere throughout much of the eastern Cordillera suggesting
that valley glacier development was limited.

High accumulation rates in contemporary ice-proximal lakes with
extensive coverage of active glaciers have been observed to be between
0.5 m/a \citep{Crookshanks2008} and as high as 1 m/a
\citep{Gilbert1997}. Similar high accumulation rates in the late-glacial
are inferred to have occurred in Quesnel Lake \citep{Gilbert2012},
resulting in a thick pre-Holocene sediment package. This evidence for
high pre/early Holocene accumulation rates in Quesnel Lake from large
dynamic glaciers suggests that high accumulation rates are also likely
for Cariboo Lake during this time.

Warming in the early Holocene, around 9.10-6.70 ka BP in the Rockies,
specifically, \citep{Luckman1986} and British Columbia, generally,
\citep{Clague1989} led to two possible sedimentation regimes. Where
glaciers persist through the warm period resulting in more regular
seasonality of sediment inputs and laminae couplet formation
\citep[e.g.~Mud Lake,][]{Hodder2006b} and where glaciers disappear
during the warm period, leading to much lower accumulation and
seasonality \citep[e.g.~Moose Lake,][]{Desloges1999}.

Sub-bottom acoustic records from Transect B shown in Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}, which is proximal to the V1 core, indicate an
upward transition from massive-unlayered (Facies A) to well-layered
sediments (Facies B) at a depth of about 20 m. Assuming a maximum
Holocene sediment accumulation rate of approximate 1.9 mm/yr from V1,
this would put this transition at about 10.5 ka BP. The massive
structure of Facies A is inferred to be due to high rates of sediment
delivery as glaciers retreated upvalley during the early Holocene after
the formation of the deep trenches. The well-layered sediment of Facies
B, along with the continuation of laminae couplets observed in cores V1
and V2 over the last 2 ka, suggests that glaciers reduced in extent at
the start of the Holocene but did not disappear completely. It is
possible during this transition from Facies A to B, glaciers retreated
above Lanezi Lake resulting in a more sediment filtering and thus a
reduction in sediment delivery and the beginning of seasonally derived
laminae couplet formation within Cariboo Lake.

Transect C, shown in Figure \ref{fig:acoustics} is located in-between
cores V1 and V2, has \textasciitilde15 m of well layered sediment
overlying a massive unlayered lower Facies A. Using a combined V1 and V2
average Holocene sediment accumulation rate of 1.7 mm/yr in this region
of the lake, puts the transition from Facies A to B at around 9 ka BP,
slightly later than the Transect B estimate. If sediment delivery was
less prior to the Neoglacial, the estimated basal ages here would be
much older. The timing of this transition is similar to the onset of
deglaciation and start of the Holocene sediment package within Mud Lake,
BC \citep{Hodder2006b} around 9.6 ka BP, at Moose Lake, BC
\citep{Desloges1999} around 10.3 ka BP, at Quesnel Lake, BC
\citep{Gilbert2012} around 8.6 ka BP, and at the Upper Bow River, AB
\citep{Leonard1999} around 11.7 ka BP.

Higher resolution AMS dated sediments from the much thinner sediment
package in the west arm of Quesnel Lake, located in the Cariboo
Mountains (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}), showed a very consistent mean
rate of sedimentation throughout the entire Holocene
\citep{Gilbert2012}. Contrasting somewhat from this pattern are results
from \citet{Menounos2009b} and \citet{Desloges1999} who note that early
to mid-Holocene sediment accumulation rates in the southeastern Canadian
Cordillera were lower than the late-Holocene Neoglacial period. However,
those shifts come from watersheds with much higher percentages of
glacier ice cover (\textasciitilde15-40\%) coupled with the probable
disappearance of glaciers during the warmer hypsithermal. So, any
extrapolation of timing to the early sediment record of Cariboo Lake
remains speculative.

Sediment inputs to Cariboo Lake are mainly delivered via the Cariboo
River delta and thus changes in watershed-wide temperature and
precipitation trends would be important. In contrast, inputs of sediment
from the small tributary watersheds that boarder Cariboo Lake are
controlled by more localized, watershed-specific responses. Although
coarser grained sediments from discrete turbidite flows are found
proximal to sidewall tributary deltas (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}), they
are only transferred to deep lake deposits during episodic events
(Figure \ref{fig:turbScatter}). The long core (V1 and V2) sediment is
composed of nearly 99\% silt and clay resulting in laminae couplets that
are inferred to have been delivered via suspended sediment from the main
Cariboo River. Therefore, trends observed in sediment accumulation at
cores V1 and V2 likely best represent waterside-wide climate and glacier
activity. While cores V1 and V2 do not produce identical results, it is
likely the sediment yield data from these cores are within the range of
7-21\% error, as reported in Evans and Church (2000) for other alpine
lakes in British Columbia. The inferred error of cores V1 and V2 is
attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of sediment accumulation across
the Cariboo Lake, and is likely on the lower end of this error range due
to its simple basin morphology. Retrieving more than two good long core
sedimentary sequences, could have provided a better estimate in the
error of sediment accumulation, however, the logistical demands of
retrieving more cores prevented this. The Cariboo River has two main
tributaries, the Upper Cariboo River and the Matthew River which are
connected to high alpine peaks and glaciers providing a significant
source of sediment (see Figure 2). Lanezi, Sandy and Ghost lakes act as
sediment traps eliminating the transfer of coarse sediment and limiting
the transfer of finer sediment from the glacier sediment production
zones. This results in sediment accumulation rates that are on the
low-end for the southeastern Cordillera \citep{Hodder2006b}. Although
connectivity is limited, there are sufficient seasonal contrasts in
suspended sediment flux to produce couplets (annual varves) in the main
basin of Cariboo Lake. This is unlike the west arm of Quesnel Lake where
sediment rates are 2 to 3 times lower due to significant storage in the
much larger upper watershed.

There is a documented range of late Holocene clastic sediment
accumulation rates in glacier-fed lakes from across the Canadian
Cordillera. Highest rates of \textgreater{} 2 cm/yr are observed in
ice-contact to ice-proximal lakes of various sizes
\citep{Desloges1994d, Crookshanks2008}, to relatively low rates of
\textless{} 1 mm/yr \citep{Gilbert2012}. The range in accumulation rates
has been understood to be a result in the variability of sediment
production from glacier processes, the steepness of topography
\citep{Ballantyne2002}, the persistence of ice cover and the degree of
basin connectivity enhancing or impeding delivery of sediment down
valley \citep{Wohl2019}. The average accumulation rate for Cariboo Lake
of 1.7 mm/yr over the last two millennia is ideal for yielding
discernible higher-resolution trends in sediment delivery over the late
Holocene. The combination of upper watershed area, intervening storage,
glacier cover and lake size are considered optimal during this period.

Actual lake sediment chronologies typically vary in their sensitivity to
regional fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, from annual
resolution in lakes with higher accumulation rates
\citep[e.g.][]{Menounos2008c} to only being able to resolve
centennial-scale or lower resolution in lakes with low accumulation
rates \citep[e.g.][]{Desloges1999}. For the last 2000 years, the Cariboo
Lake record is very high resolution. Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}a
shows the (inferred) varve thickness chronology reconstructed as
standardized departures from cores V1 and V2. There is a significant
amount of noise in the record, typical of a filtered sediment transport
system \citep[e.g.][]{Jerolmack2010}, so a lower resolution 30-year
moving average is superimposed on the raw couplet thickness data in
Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}a. Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}b
and \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}c show the lower-resolution temporal
patterns in D\textsubscript{50} grain size and organic matter content,
respectively. These trends are compared against the \citet{Moberg2005}
regional climate proxy re-analysis for the northern hemisphere (Figure
\ref{fig:proxy-comparison}d), \citet{Solomina2016} western Canada peak
glacier extent estimates (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}e), and
\citet{Ljungqvist2016} hydroclimate anomaly estimates for the northern
hemisphere (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}f). Most of these are at
resolutions of centennial scale or lower.

For Cariboo Lake, above average varve thickness, grain size, and organic
matter are observed for both V1 and V2 from 0-700 CE which is coincident
with the peak extent of the first millennial glacier advance
\citep{Solomina2016}, and below average temperatures in the Northern
Hemisphere \citep{Ljungqvist2016}. While above average grain size and
varve thickness are expected during a time of increased glacier extent
due to higher rates of sediment production and delivery. Above average
organic matter could be explained by some contribution of increased soil
erosion below treeline during a time of higher precipitation rates and
subsequent high spring freshet flows. As temperatures warmed following
the first millennial advance from 700-1200 CE into the Medieval Warm
Period, a decline in varve thickness and grain size is observed while
organic matter remains high during a warmer and dryer climate. Over the
Little Ice Age, varves are thicker and coarser, and organic matter
content remains average to below average as glaciers advance in a colder
and wetter climate. Following the LIA, a dramatic decline in organic
matter is observed coincident with above average grain size suggestive
of high magnitude clastic sediment delivery. The response of Cariboo
Lake sediment accumulation appears to be more sensitive (higher
variability in the original standardized departures of varve thickness)
to glacier activity during the LIA compared to previous advances around
500 CE and 1200-1500 CE. There is some evidence for a rapid increase in
grain size and reduction in OM content in the 20\textsuperscript{th}
century portion of the record. It is tempting to conclude that
20\textsuperscript{th} century warming in the main cause. However,
hydraulic mining practices during the Cariboo Gold Rush and
deforestation began during the late 1800s and may have contributed to
these anomalies.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The moderated-sized Cariboo Lake provides a very good record of
deglacial and Holocene sediment inputs. The steep climatic gradient from
the wetter, glacier covered, headwaters to the semi-arid, lower
elevation zones of the lake, result in sediment input via the main
Cariboo Lake delta that is predominately derived from the glacier
production zone. This conclusion is supported by the down-lake trends
observed in grain-size and organic matter content. The smaller
alluvial-fan deltas from side tributaries appear to be paraglacial relic
features, similar to those described in \citet{Church1972}, and likely
formed during deglaciation and the earliest Holocene as no evidence of
significant inputs during the Holocene were found in this study.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  Sub-bottom acoustic records provide a coarse temporal resolution
  chronology of early and mid-Holocene sediment accumulation. The
  transition of massive to well-layered sediments occurs around 10.5 to
  9 ka BP. This is similar to other lakes in the region suggesting
  fairly consistent and rapid withdrawal of valley-bottom glacier ice
  into the highest elevation zones.
\item
  There are still limitations in the ability to retrieve sufficiently
  long cores (\textgreater{} 10-15 m), that would provide a high
  resolution record of sediment inputs over the entire Holocene. If
  trends observed in other southern Canadian Cordilleran lakes prevail,
  the early and mid-Holocene input of sediment during the hypsithermal
  would have been significantly reduced resulting in a Holocene sediment
  package within the 10-15 m range. Acoustic Facies B most likely
  represents this unit.
\item
  Sedimentary structures in the long cores indicated sediment delivery
  over the late Holocene to present is dominated by overflow currents of
  silt (spring freshet) and clay (winter settling) resulting in the
  formation of rhythmically laminated couplets that are mainly varves.
  While there is relatively close agreement between sediment chronology
  from laminae counting and the two AMS dates, it is not possible to
  develop a chronology that provides a precisely dated sediment yield
  record over the last 2 ka. However, the observed mean accumulation
  rate (1.7 mm/yr), the variance in accumulation rate and the
  low-frequency trends are important indicators of late Holocene
  environmental change.
\item
  Periods of peak glacier extent, such as during the First Millennial
  Advance (\textasciitilde{} 200 to 700 CE) and Little Ice Age
  (\textasciitilde1600 to 1900 CE) are correlated with thicker and
  coarser varves in Cariboo Lake. We conclude that sediment accumulation
  in Cariboo Lake was more sensitive to glacier activity during the LIA
  compared to earlier advances. Trends in organic matter content appear
  to be less correlated with watershed sediment delivery and may be more
  sensitive to vegetation changes in the basin.
\item
  Trends in sediment characteristics after 1860 CE may be related to
  climate warming following the LIA. However, there are complications in
  this watershed via large-scale mining proximal to the lake and some
  upper watershed deforestation. They also may have been contributing
  factors to an increase in sediment delivery to the lake.
\end{enumerate}

The average sediment accumulation rate of 1.7 mm/yr is ideal for
yielding higher-resolution trends in sediment delivery over the last two
millennia. Above average varve thickness and grain size is observed from
0 to 700 CE, below average from 700 to 1500 CE, and average to above
average from 1500 CE to present. Trends in organic matter appear to be
less correlated with watershed sediment delivery and may be more
sensitive to vegetation changes in the basin.
