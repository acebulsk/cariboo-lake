\begin{abstract}
An acoustic record of sedimentation and sediment cores from Cariboo Lake
are analyzed to present a high-resolution record of sediment
accumulation. Acoustically penetrable sediment reaches a maximum
thickness of 35 m in deep parts of the lake, representing deglacial and
Holocene accumulation. A transition from massive to well-layered
sediments is observed in the sub-bottom acoustic record during final
phases of valley deglaciation in the region (ca. 10.5-9 ka BP). Fine
clastic sediments produced from the glaciated headwaters are delivered
by Cariboo River as over-flow currents into the lake which produce
bimodal rhythmic layering of silt and clay sediments. Laminae couplets
are inferred to be deposited annually according to two AMS radiocarbon
dates and a varve counting chronology. Two long cores, 2.9 and 3.8 m in
length, were selected for analysis with estimated basal dates of 2 ka
BP. \textbf{Prominant volcanic reflectors for the region pre-date the
long cores and the chronology is based on two radiocarbon dates and
laminae couplet counting.} The accumulation of sediment into Cariboo
Lake shows above average sediment accumulation rates between 0-700CE and
1500-2017CE which are coincident with cool temperatures and peak glacier
extents. Cariboo Lake is situated in a mountainous region of British
Columbia Canada and is representative of environments transitioning from
semi-arid interior climates to glaciated high mountain regions to the
east. The sediment chronology presented in this study contributes to the
existing body of knowledge of lake sediment accumulation and Holocene
watershed activity for this transitional climate region of western
Canada.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Environmental proxies that extend back beyond the modern observable
record are crucial to understanding earth system processes
\citep{Turney2019, Huber2012, Nelson2016}. Proxy reconstructions at the
sub-annual scale (e.g.~ice cores, tree rings, and corals), to
multi-decadal scales (e.g.~sediments, pollen, boreholes) have proven
useful in describing past environmental conditions across the globe
\citep{Masson2013}. In the case of sedimentary sequences collected from
climate sensitive glaciated watersheds, they have been important in
contributing to the regional understanding of climate and hydrologic
variability over the Holocene. For example, research by
\citet{Neukom2019} have utilized sedimentary sequences as part of larger
paleolimnological collections to provide global reconstructions of
temperature variability over the last 2000 years.

The climatic setting in western Canada over the Holocene contributed to
several fluctuations in glacial activity with implications for sediment
accumulation in glacier-fed lakes. Multi-proxy analyses of lake
sediments from Vancouver Island \citep{Brown2006}, south central British
Columbia \citep{Lowe1997} and northern Washington \citep{Steinman2019}
suggest low lake levels and precipitation amounts during the early
Holocene around 11.0 to 7.50 ka. Glacier extents in western Canada
during the early Holocene in the southern Coast Mountains
\citep{Menounos2004, Koch2007a, Osborn2007} and Canadian Rocky Mountain
\citep{Luckman1988, Luckman1993} have been found to be reduced relative
to the late Holocene. During the Early Neoglacial (7.50-5.00 ka),
glaciers increased in extent in the south Coast Mountains
\citep{Osborn2007, Filippelli2006, Ryder1986} with some limited evidence
in the Interior ranges and Rocky Mountains \citep{Luckman1993}. During
the Early-middle Neoglacial (5.00-3.50 ka), there is widespread evidence
of at least two glacial advances across western Canada from material
dated in glacial forefields and clastic sedimentation
\citep{Koch2007a, Osborn2007, Menounos2008c, Gardner1985, Wood2004, Hodder2006b, Desloges1999, Leonard1999}.
During the Middle-late Neoglacial (3.50-1.00 ka), two periods of glacier
advance have been reported. In the central and eastern ranges of Canada,
records support extensive glacier coverage around 3.5-2.77 ka and
1.8-1.5 ka from lacustrine sediment
\citep{Leonard1999, Leonard1997, Dirszowsky1997a, Desloges1999} and from
log and stump material between
\citep{Wood2004, Luckman1995, Luckman1999}. The Little Ice Age (LIA)
includes glacier advances over the past millennium and have been
reported as broadly synchronous from Alaska to Patagonia
\citep{Luckman2000e}. In the Canadian Rocky Mountains many glaciers
reached peak glacier extents during the LIA, and are estimated to be
centered around CE1250 \citep{Luckman1995, Osborn2001, Leonard1997} and
CE1850 \citep{Luckman2000e, Leonard1997}. Over the Holocene there is
general regional agreement on the timing and magnitude of the large
Early Holocene retreat and Late Holocene LIA advance however, the
smaller fluctuations that occurred between these large events have less
regional agreement \citep{Menounos2009b}.

In the western Cordillera of Canada, recovered sedimentary sequences
have been collected to better understand the hydroclimatic and glacial
history of the Coast Mountains \citep{Menounos2008c}, St.~Elias
Mountains \citep{Crookshanks2008}, Monashee Mountains
\citep{Hodder2006b}, and Rocky Mountains
\citep{Leonard1986, Dirszowsky1997a, Desloges1999}. A study of Quesnel
Lake (272 km\textsuperscript{2}), 30 km south of the study area examined
here, by \citet{Gilbert2012} found deglacial, and the very earliest
Holocene, sediment infills to be high at around 10.4 ka BP, declining
significantly at around 8.4 ka BP. Trends in Quesnel Lake sediment
characteristics during the Holocene were not detectable as accumulation
rates were very low in the areas of the lake that could be sampled.
Quesnel Lake is very large relative to the contributing watershed and
therefore the sediment system is much less sensitive to climate
variability. Aside from the \citet{Gilbert2012} study on Quesnel Lake,
records of holocene glacial and hydroclimatic variability have been
primarily collected proximal to the Coast and Rocky Mountains.
Additional records for the transitional climate between these two
mountain ranges are needed especially during the mid to late Holocene
where greater regional variability in the glacial and climate response
has been observed \citep{Steinman2019, Menounos2009b}.

\textbf{Previous studies glacier-fed lakes have had success relating
lake bottom sediment archives (e.g.~varves, grain size and organic
content) to changes in regional temperature, precipitation patterns, and
glacier extent over the Holocene
\citep{Desloges1999, Hodder2006b, Leonard1997, Menounos2006b, Menounos2008c}.
Mountain basins that exhibit a distinct nival-hydrographic regime
typically produce distinct varve couplets with a fine-grained layer
deposited in winter when the lake ices over and flow velocity decreases
followed by a coarse-grained layer deposited during spring high flows
\citep[e.g.][]{Leonard1997, Hodder2007c, Desloges1999}. In contrast,
Lakes proximal to the coast of British Columbia typically show a higher
degree noise in their varve record due to the influence of multiple
large fall rain storms (Atmospheric Rivers) that produce multiple coarse
laminations within a single season
\citep[e.g.][]{Gilbert1997, Menounos2008c}. This can result in a much
larger coarse grain fraction compared to the fine grained and may lead
to reduced sensitivity to watershed wide climate and glacial signal.}

\textbf{Lakes that are more distal from glacier activity typically have
relatively lower sediment inputs, due to the upstream filtering of
rivers and/or lakes which limits the coarser fraction of sediment but
still allow some input of the fine fraction \citep{Hodder2007c}. The
effect of this filtering effect on the climate and hydrology signal may
contribute to a weak signal to noise ratio and reduced sensitivity to
hydroclimatic variability if local sediment sources outweigh the
delivery of sediment from headwater sources \citep{Jerolmack2010}.
However, lakes with moderate upstream filtering that maintain a high
fraction of fine clastic sediments produced in the glaciated headwaters
are likely to maintain sensitivity to the hydroclimatic signal of the
basin.}

\textbf{Establishing a correlation between seasonal or annual trends in
varve thickness, grain size, and organic content from sediment cores to
local discharge, temperature, and precipitation is not always possible
due to complex process interactions
\citep{Hodder2007c, Menounos2008c, Heideman2017}. \citet{Hodder2007c}
describes the process systems that may influence the variability in
sediment delivery to a lake which include: climate, glacier, fluvial,
geomorphic, terrestrial biologic, and lacustrine systems. Due to the
multiple interactions between these systems, the linkage between the
lake sediment signal and climate is typically weak at time scales less
than 10 years \citep{Hodder2007c, Menounos2008c, Heideman2017}. Trends
in lake sediment sequences are typically more representative to climate
fluctuations at longer time scales over over 100 years
\citep{Leonard1999, Osborn2007, Heideman2017}.}

\textbf{The chronology of sedimentary sequences in prior studies are
typically derived from a combination of radiocarbon dating
\citep{Gilbert2012, Hodder2006b, Steinman2019}, identification of
volcanic tephra layers \citep{Gilbert2012, Hodder2006b, Steinman2019}
and counting of visable annual laminations (varves)
\citep{Hodder2006b, Heideman2015}. The Mt. Mazama vocanic eruption is
the most prominent tephra layer typically found in sediment sequences in
western Canada \citep{Gilbert2012, Steinman2019} and has been dated to
roughly to have an age of 7600 cal. BP
\citep{Zdanowicz1999, Hallett1997}. \citet{Westgate1977} reports the
most recent major volcanic ash event to reach central BC occurred 2100
yr BP, predating the basal age of the four sediment cores presented in
this study. Younger sedimentary sequences, for example the 825 year
record collected from Lillooet Lake, British Columbia, have provided
chronologies using a combination of varve counting and radiocarbon
dating in the absence of discernable tephra layers.}

\textbf{In addition to sedimentary sequences, acoustic remote sensing of
lake bottom sediments is another method that has been used successfully
to reveal the history of sediment infill
\citep{Desloges1994d, Hodder2006b, Gilbert2012, VanRensbergen1999}.
Acoustic profiles of lake-bottom sediments provide information about
facies in the sediment stratigraphy using variations in sound
propagation \citep{LeBlanc1992}. The acoustic profiles may also provide
coarse resolution (\textasciitilde1000 yr) data regarding differences in
the grain size of sediment \citep[e.g.~strong acoustic reflectors
correlated to an energetic sedimentary environment in][]{Hodder2006b}.}

\textbf{Few sedimentary sequences exist in central British Columbia that
provide a high resolution and long term record of hydroclimatic
variability \citep{Gilbert2012, Hodder2006b}. The sedimentary sequence
from Cariboo Lake presented here, fills this gap by providing a new
record of Holocene hydroclimatic variability for the transitional zone
between the Coastal and Rocky Mountains using lake bottom sediment
records recovered using sub-bottom acoustic methods and long sediments
cores.}

The purpose of this research is to 1) establish an understanding of the
mechanisms that control the delivery and deposition of the fine sediment
fraction to Cariboo Lake, 2) to reconstruct the highest resolution and
longest term sediment accumulation record possible for this area of
British Columbia, 3) compare and contrast the accumulation record in
this transitional (semi-arid to glaciated mountainous) lake system with
existing sedimentary sequences and regional climate proxies in western
Canada.

\section{Study Area}\label{study-area}}

Cariboo Lake is located in the northern foothills of the Columbia
Mountains, 85 km northeast of Williams Lake, British Columbia (Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}). The lake receives runoff from an area of 3244
km\textsuperscript{2}, which is filtered by three deep fjord like lakes
Issac Lake, Lanezi Lake, and Ghost Lake shown in Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}. The watershed relief ranges from 2600 m asl. in the
eastern headwaters to 600 m asl. at the western Cariboo Lake outlet. The
west to east, 90 km long watershed spans climate ranging from 1370 mm/yr
in the headwaters to 477 mm/yr at the semi-arid outlet to the lake. The
area of Cariboo Lake is 10 km\textsuperscript{2} resulting in a lake
area-to-watershed area ratio of 0.3\%. The Cariboo Lake watershed has 64
km\textsuperscript{2} of permanent ice cover which covers 2\% of the
total watershed \citep{Bolch2008}. The most extensive glaciated terrain
is proximal to Mt. Lunn roughly 60 km upstream of Cariboo Lake (Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}). \textbf{The Cariboo Lake basin hydrology is snow-
and glacier-melt dominant with average 1971-2000 monthly runoff peaking
in June and low-flows occur between December and March (Figure
\ref{fig:cl-hydro}, A). From December to March the air temperature is
mostly below 0 °C and precipitation falls primarily as snow during these
months (Figure \ref{fig:cl-hydro}).}

The top of each bar on panel C corresponds to the average monthly total precipitation and the coloured portion shows the fraction of rain or snow.}\label{fig:cl-hydro}
\end{figure}

The Cariboo River, draining into the east margin of the lake, is the
main source of sediment. The lake is separated into two basins, by a
large alluvial fan building cross-valley from Keithley Creek (Figure
\ref{fig:map-lake}). The surface area of the upstream basin is 8
km\textsuperscript{2} and is referred to here as the main Cariboo Lake
basin. The downstream basin, referred to here as the Keithley Creek
sub-basin, is 2 km\textsuperscript{2} in surface. The bathymetry of the
lake reaches a maximum depth of over 50 m in two deep holes within the
central part of the main Cariboo Lake basin. \textbf{These deep holes
provide some evidence of past glacial scouring and ice extents that
reached the lake.}

\end{figure}

Sediment connectivity to headwater glaciers along the Cariboo River is
limited due to lake filtering by Lanezi and Sandy lake (Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}). Lanezi Lake is a deep fjord-like lake with a
bathymetry reaching a maximum depth of 170 m. \textbf{The flat lake
bottom bathymetry of Lanezi lake suggests sediment delivery to this lake
has been relatively high over the Holocene.} Sandy Lake is much
shallower reaching a maximum depth of 6 m. The Matthews River, which
meets the Cariboo River just below Lanezi Lake provides a less filtered
connection to meltwater sources draining several alpine glaciers
including the largest area of ice (10 km\textsuperscript{2}) in the
Cariboo Lake watershed, proximal to Roberts Peak (Figure
\ref{fig:map-basin}).

\subsection{Field Methods}\label{field-methods}}

A field campaign was conducted during the summer of 2017 to collect
sub-bottom acoustic soundings, dredge samples, and sediment cores.
Thirty-four km of sub-bottom acoustic soundings were collected across
Cariboo Lake using a 10 kHz StrataBox 3510 HD. An Ekman dredge was used
to collect 20 samples from the lake bottom, each yielding
\textasciitilde730 cm\textsuperscript{3} of surficial sediment. The
dredge samples were sub-sampled in the field using an 80 mm diameter PVC
cylinder pushed into the block of sediment. This resulted in 20 short
cores each containing about 450 cm\textsuperscript{3} of sediment.
\textbf{The Ekman dredge filled with variable depths of sediment and as
a result the short cores ranged from 6 to 12 cm in length.} The
remaining sediment not captured in the PVC cylinder was kept as a bulk
sediment sample. Four long sediment cores (V1-V4) were collected using a
Rossfelder submersible vibracorer with a 6 m long 70 mm diameter
aluminum pipe. The Ekman short cores and the long vibracores were split
longitudinally with one half preserved as an archive and the other as a
working half. The working half samples were prepared for imaging by
scraping the core parallel to the sediment laminae to create a flat
surface which showed the sediment stratigraphy. \textbf{The stratigraphy
of long cores V1 and V2 were selected for detailed analysis as they were
located within the deepest two basins of Cariboo Lake. The deep sampling
location was important to ensure a higher fraction of fine clastic
sediments delivered via overflow currents from the main Cariboo River
compared to coarser sediments from valley sidewalls and turbidite flood
events. Cores V3 and V4 taken at shallower depths had a higher fraction
of coarse grained sediments and resulted in a higher degree of core
disturbance, presumably due to the lower cohesion of the coarser grained
sediments.}

\hypertarget{laboratory-methods}{%
\subsection{Laboratory Methods}\label{laboratory-methods}}

The cores and short cores were analyzed for laminae thickness, organic
content, and particle size. The working halves of long cores V1 and V2
were subsampled with 2 cm\textsuperscript{3} of sediment extracted at a
5 cm interval, with additional samples taken within stratigraphic
breaks. Stratigraphic breaks were identified based on visual changes in
grain size and lamination patterns. Laminae couplets observed on the
\textbf{working halves} were digitally counted and measured for
thickness using the ImageJ software, by \citet{Schneider2012}.
\textbf{Uncertainty in laminae counting is attributed to sections of
core with indiscernible laminae formation, core compaction,
undercounting, and subjectivity in classifying the occasionally thicker
(4 to 47 mm thick) graded to massive laminae/beds. Varve counting
uncertainties in the literature are reported as 0.7 - 6 \% from
\citet{Menounos2008c} and \citet{Birlo2022} respectively and are
typically calculated using marker varves. An uncertainty estimate was
not possible to attribute to the Cariboo Lake long-core laminae counting
since there were no clear marker varves or tephras observed in the
sediment cores.} The top section of cores V1 and V2 were disturbed
during coring - 110 mm for V1 and 70 mm for V2 which prevented counting
and measurement of laminae couplets. Organic content was determined by
loss-on-ignition analysis (550 °C) following methods in
\citet{Smith2003}. Samples were first weighed to provide an initial wet
weight, then dried at 60 °C and weighed again after oven drying. The
samples were then placed in a furnace at 550 °C for 2.5 hours and
weighed a third time. Grain size analysis was conducted using a
Mastersizer Particle Size Analyzer 3000. Samples were prepared following
methods by \citet{Gray2010} to remove the fine fraction of particles
from organic material. This involved a removal of organic material using
three sequential alloquots of 20\% H\textsubscript{2}0\textsubscript{2}
until the sample stopped reacting. To prevent flocculation of sediment
grains the samples were dispersed in 0.05\% solution of Calgon for 24
hours. Grain size was measured three times for each sample, resulting in
an average standard deviation of +/- 0.01 µm. The chronology of both
vibra cores was reconstructed using AMS \textsuperscript{14}C dating of
three wood fragments (analyzed at the André E. Lalonde AMS Laboratory at
the University of Ottawa) and a chronology derived from laminae
(couplet) counting on working core images. The AMS \textsuperscript{14}C
calibration was performed using Bchron, a Baysesian statistical
age-model software package for R
\citep{Parnell2008, Parnell2011, Haslett2008} and the IntCal13
calibration curve \citep{Reimer2013}.

\subsection{Sub-bottom Acoustics}\label{sub-bottom-acoustics}}

Acoustic stratigraphy from six selected transects (see locations in
Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}) reveal the range of morphologies and
character of sedimentary deposits in Cariboo Lake (Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}). Acoustic penetration is limited in transects A and
E by coarser sediments proximal to river fan-deltas across Cariboo Lake
(see triangle symbols in Figure \ref{fig:map-lake} for fan-delta
locations). Acoustic signal penetration, resolution and distinctive
acoustic layering improves significantly along the thalweg of the lake
bottom away from the main Cariboo River delta and in cross-lake
transects more distal from the valley-side fan-deltas. \textbf{The
diagnal lines across all panels (cross-hatching) in Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics} is observed over most of the acoustic record due to
errant electrical interference from the research vessel that could not
be resolved.} However, the interference does not affect the overall
quality of the acoustic results in the six selected transects (Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}, A-F).

Transect A, one kilometer southwest of the headwater Cariboo River
delta, has a strong acoustic reflector at the sediment-water interface
indicating the presence of coarser-grained material on the lakebed
(Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, A). Grab samples on this transect show a
high fraction of sandy materials which act as an acoustic mask limiting
the penetration of the acoustic signal to a depth of 1-2 m. An acoustic
multiple (echo) is observed 45 m below the sediment surface caused by
the limited penetration at the surface (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, A -
i). Acoustically penetrable, well-layered sediment is observed 3.5 km
from the Cariboo River delta in transect B (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics},
B). This site is proximal to long core V1. Acoustic reflectors with 1-2
m separation lie conformably over a hummocky basement which is observed
on the south side of the transect (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, B - i).
The acoustic basement drops off below the observable record near the
south channel-like depression. Well structured layering extends across
the south side of the transect but pinches out towards the north shore
(Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, B, C \& D). On the south side of transect
B, the thickness of the well structured layering ranges from 10 to 20 m.
Underlying the layered sediments is a more massively layered facies
which ranges from 12 to 25 m thick before the record is cut off below
the maximum depth of the record of 80 m.

\begin{figure}

Transect C: (i) denotes inferred bedrock or coarse late-glacial material. (ii) and (iii) are v-notch scour channels. (A) and (B) are sediment facies. Transect D: Scour channels are denoted by (i) and (ii). Slumping is observed at (iii).}\label{fig:acoustics}
\end{figure}

Acoustic penetration increases 4.5 km from the Cariboo River delta at
transect C (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C). The acoustic record along
this transect reaches a maximum sediment thickness of 35 m in two
troughs, the maximum thickness of surficial sediments observed across
Cariboo Lake in this study. The acoustic basement is considered to be
either bedrock or coarse-grained glacial sediment from the Last Glacial
Maximum (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C -- i). Two sediment facies are
observed across this transect based on geometry and the strength and
continuity of reflectors. Some disruption of these facies is caused by
slumping of side slopes (e.g.~north end of transect C). The lower unit,
facies A, has a thickness of \textasciitilde{} 12 m along undisturbed
sections (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C) and is more massive to weakly
acoustically layered. The contact with overlying sediment above facies A
appears to be conformable at the south end and middle of the transect
but unconformable in other places. The unconformities are most apparent
in the two sharp crested v-notch channels at the middle of the transect.
These channels are a continuation of those noted in transect B. These
are inferred to be scour channels formed by erosive, higher energy,
turbidity currents that probably date to deglaciation of the lake basin.
The lack of numerous layers and generally lighter grey tone in facies A
indicates a somewhat higher energy and more rapid deposition of coarser
lacustrine sediment. Facies B begins with high-amplitude parallel
reflectors with 2-3 m separation and conforms well with facies A below
(Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C). Facies B has a thickness of
\textasciitilde{} 10 m along undisturbed sections and deepens to a
maximum of 13 m within the scour channels (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C
- ii \& iii). The strength of reflectors in facies B are stronger and
more numerous than those in facies A indicating more frequent events of
lower overall magnitude during this time. The strength of reflectors
gradually decreases moving upwards and spacing thins to sub metre
thickness near the surface. The gradual decrease in reflectance is
interrupted by a strong reflector at the top of facies B along the
sediment-water interface.

The two buried troughs in transect C (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, C -
ii, iii) are significant and best expressed in this area of the lake.
The north trough (ii) appears to be a depression that was continuously
infilled by facies A and then B. Hence it most likely represents an
older pre-existing feature. The sediments in the southern trough (iii)
are interesting in that a wedge of sediment infill seems to be an
unconformable deposit with both facies B below and facies A above. This
wedge of sediment is observed in Figure \ref{fig:acoustics} above label
C-iii characterized by a deepening of facies B and darker in color than
facies A. It is likely that an erosional channel developed after or in
the later stages of facies A deposition which infilled the wedge.
Sedimentation of the wedge was then truncated by the onset of the facies
B sediment. While the two troughs might have been active at the same
time during deglaciation, only the southern trough was reactivated at a
later time and infilled with sediment prior to the onset of facies B
deposition.

Transect D, to the northeast of the Frank Creek delta has well-layered
sediments in the top 5-10 m and transitions to poor acoustic penetration
below this (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, D). The parallel reflectors
observed in the uppermost sediment layers of transect D have a thickness
of 2-3 m and have a higher amplitude compared to facies B in transect C.
Some slumping of sidewall sediments is observed on the south sidewall
(Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}, D).

Southwest of the Frank Creek fan-delta, acoustic reflectors along
transect E show a decline in reflectance and a decrease in layer
thickness to \textless{} 1 m. Acoustic masking from coarse grained
sediment occurs at depths of 2-4 m along the south margin (Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}, E). Total sediment thickness of finer, acoustically
well-layered material along the north bench is significant approaching
10 m. The profile suggests that much of the suspended sediment
transported from the upper lake does not make it past the shallow lake
depths (\textless{} 20 m) of the sill at the Frank Creek fan-delta apart
from the northern most part of the transect. Coarser sediment from the
Frank Creek fan-delta dominates the south side of the transect and fine
sediment deposition is restricted, or forced, to the north side.

Similar to the Frank Creek fan-delta, the very shallow sill of less than
2 m opposite the Keithley Creek prograding fan-delta significantly
reduces sediment connectivity to the main Cariboo Lake basin (see
triangle proximal to Keithley Creek in Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}).
Transect F, located close to the centre of the Keithley Creek sub-basin
shows a maximum observable sediment thickness of 4 m concentrated in the
basin thalweg (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}). Below this there is acoustic
masking by coarser sediment. The acoustic reflectors within the top 4 m
of transect F are acoustically penetrable, well layered and are
conformable to the basin morphology. These reflectors are of higher
amplitude compared to those in transect E and are thicker at 1-2 m. This
suggests that significant amounts of coarse-grained sediments are found
in this part of the lake, likely originating from the high energy
Keithley Creek drainage basin. Fine faction sediments from the main
Cariboo Lake are expected to make up a small percentage as transport
into this sub-basin is limited by up-lake storage, filtering and
hypopycnal overpassing.

\subsection{Spatial Trends in Surficial Sediment}\label{spatial}}

Twenty surficial sediment cores ranging from 6-12 cm thick were analyzed
for grain size, laminae thickness, and organic content. These samples
were collected following a longitudinal transect down Cariboo Lake and
indicate how sediment flux varies with distance from the Cariboo River
delta (see Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}, for sampling locations).
\textbf{The percent of sand-sized sediments follows an exponential
decline with distance down-lake starting at 60.8 \% sand proximal to the
Cariboo River delta and reaching a low of 0.15 \%, 5.2 km km from the
Cariboo River delta (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, A). The
D\textsubscript{50} grain size also follows a steep decline from 89.9
µm, 300 m from the delta, to 31.3 µm 550 m from the Cariboo River delta
(Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, B). The decline in D\textsubscript{90}
grain size follows a more pronounced decline, while the
D\textsubscript{10} remains largely unchanged. This suggests that larger
sand-sized sediments (63-2000 µm) are sensitive to distance from fan
deltas, while smaller silt-sized (2-63 µm) and clay-sized (0.01-2 µm)
sediments are less sensitive. At distances greater than 2 km from the
Cariboo River delta the fraction of silt-sized sediments remains at over
80 \%, aside from core E16 which is near the Frank Creek fan-delta. The
highest percent of silt (86.5-89.6 \%) and clay (9.3-14.4 \%) sized
sediments are observed between 3 and 6.5 km from the Cariboo River
delta, proximal to the long core sampling locations.} Near to the Frank
Creek fan-delta the D\textsubscript{50} grain size nearly doubles in
size from 7.92 µm at 6.4 km to 15.1 µm at 7.35 km from the Cariboo River
delta. In the Keithley Creek sub-basin the D\textsubscript{50} grain
size has an average grain size of 15.9 µm (n = 3) and the composition of
sediment is 4.0\% clay, 85.8\% silt, and 10.2\% sand (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, A, B).

Proximal to the Cariboo River delta (\textless{} 500 m) the structure of
the surficial sediments exhibits massive layering, erosive contacts and
the fraction of sand grains in these samples is greater than 60\%. A
sand-bed with a thickness of 1 cm is observed in the bulk sample closest
to the Cariboo River delta (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, A). In the main
Cariboo River basin, core E13 had the most distinct laminations and was
taken 5.24 km from the Cariboo River delta, proximal to long core V2, in
the deepest part at a depth of 40 m. Sediment here shows rhythmic
lamination (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, B).

\end{figure}

Sediment cores E9-E15 and E18-E20, retrieved from areas in Cariboo Lake
that are distal from river deltas and have lake depths of 30-50 m, have
a high fraction of silt and clay sediment and exhibit a sequence of
fine-grained dark layers followed by coarse-grained light layers (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, B \& C). \textbf{The sediment stratigraphy observed
within cores E9-E15 and E18-E20 is similar to annual laminations (also
called varves) observed in many other lakes
\citep{Cockburn2008, Zolitschka2015a, Heideman2015, Hodder2006b, Desloges1999}
that have sufficient seasonal variation in river discharge and lake
stratification. In the Cariboo Lake basin, winter low flows, lake-ice
cover, and lake stratification reduce the velocity of lake currents and
contribute to the deposition of fine-grained sediments on the lake
bottom. During the spring nival high flows, coarser-grained sediments
are deposited as a result of higher energy lake currents. Outside of
spring, additional deposits of coarse-grained sediment may result due to
abnormally high discharge events such as large rain or snow-melt events
and/or turbidite beds due to delta collapse \citep{sabatier2022}.
Coastal lakes in western Canada that are frequented by large rain storms
and mid-winter melt events lead to multiple laminae couplets deposited
in a given year \citep{Menounos2008c}. However, the distinct
snowmelt-dominant hydrological regime of the Cariboo Lake watershed
shown in Figure \ref{fig:cl-hydro} suggests the deposit of multiple
coarse-grained laminae in one year is rare. Coarse-grained deposits of
sediment are still possible in Cariboo Lake due to turbidite beds from
delta collapse however these turbidite beds are only observed in Ekman
cores proximal to river deltas (e.g.~\ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, A). While the
sediment stratigraphy of Ekman cores E9-E15 and E18-E20 resemble varves,
further analysis of the Cariboo Lake long-cores and C14 chronology is
required to confirm this.}

The thickness of sediment laminae couplets within cores E9-E15 and
E18-E20 demonstrate a gradual decreasing trend with distance down-lake
from the Cariboo River delta (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, B). This
suggests the Cariboo River is the main source of sediment into Cariboo
Lake as sediment flux typically declines with distance from the primary
sediment source. Maximum couplet thickness has an average of 4.7 mm (n =
6) in the Cariboo River basin and 7.9 mm (n = 3) in the Keithley Creek
sub-basin. In the Cariboo River basin, maximum couplet thickness
decreases by 0.62 mm/km and by 2.17 mm/km in the Keithley Creek
sub-basin with distance down-lake (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, B). The
decline in thickness is more rapid in the Keithley Creek sub-basin is
likely due to additional local inputs of coarser grained sediment coming
from the Keithley Creek tributary.

Trends in percent organic matter (OM) of surficial sediment cores were
not found to exhibit systematic patterns with distance down-lake (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, C). \textbf{The lowest OM values were observed in
the Keithley Creek sub-basin and suggest higher levels of clastic
sediment yield in this basin which dilutes the OM.}

The results from particle size, laminae thickness, and percent organics
\textbf{supports the hypothesis that} sediment delivered from the main
Cariboo River is the primary source of sediment to Cariboo Lake. Massive
layering of sediment and coarse-grained particle sizes are limited to
areas proximal to Pine Creek, Frank Creek and Keithley Creek deltas
where localized turbidity currents are active. Outside of these areas,
where turbidity currents and bedload transport processes are reduced,
the sediment in Cariboo Lake is largely comprised of rhythmically
laminated silt and clay sediments likely transported primarily through
suspended sediment processes from the main Cariboo River. In the
Keithley Creek sub-basin grain size and laminae structures are larger in
size than those observed in the main Cariboo River basin suggesting
local sediment inputs from the Keithley Creek are significant (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, C).

\hypertarget{sediment-accumulation-chronology}{%
\subsection{Sediment Accumulation
Chronology}\label{sediment-accumulation-chronology}}

Four vibra sediment cores, ranging from 2 -- 4 m in length, were
retrieved from the deepest portions of Cariboo Lake (Figure
\ref{fig:map-lake}). Cores V1 (3 m) and V2 (4 m) in the main Cariboo
River basin were selected for detailed analysis as these two cores had
organic material for AMS radiocarbon dating, and their sedimentary
record was well preserved. The chronology of the two cores is provided
by a small number of AMS radiocarbon dates and laminae counting. No
evidence of volcanic tephra was found within either of the two cores
through visual color changes. \textbf{Since the most prominent ash
deposits observed in western Canada predate the basal age of the two
cores \citep{Westgate1977, Hallett1997}, smaller tephra layers within
the core were not as easy to identify}. This combined with the dark
colour of the clastic core sediments prevented finding smaller volcanic
ash events within the cores. The chronology of the Cariboo lake core
records of grain size, varve thickness, and organic content from these
two cores demonstrate patterns in sediment delivery to Cariboo Lake over
the past 2000 years.

\hypertarget{chronology}{%
\subsubsection{Chronology}\label{chronology}}

Organic material for dating in the clastic dominated cores was extremely
limited. AMS radiocarbon dates obtained for cores V1 and V2 are
presented in Table \ref{tab:amsDates} and provide limited temporal
control and evidence of sediment accumulation rates for the long cores.
A small twig from V1 at 343 cm and combination of two separate organic
pieces which were combined into one sample at V2, with an average depth
of 281 cm, yielding a calibrated \citep{Reimer2013} two-sigma date range
of 1918-1820 cal BP and 2043‐1895 cal BP respectively. Figure
\ref{fig:amsRates} shows the C14 chronology for V1 and V2 compared to
the laminae couplet chronologies for E13, V1, and V2. The C14 dates from
samples V1 and V2 yield consistent accumulation rates \textbf{(depth of
sample divided by age of sample)} of 1.76 +/- 0.05 mm/yr and 1.37 +/-
0.05 mm/yr respectively.

\end{figure}

Ekman surficial core 13 (E13), shown in Figure \ref{fig:amsRates}, is
most proximal to the V2 long core (see Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}) and
exhibits similar sediment accumulation compared to the C14 and laminae
chronology of V2. The light-dark couplets in E13, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanImgs}, are similar to annual deposits noted in dozens of
other lakes throughout BC \citep[e.g.][]{Hodder2006b}. Therefore, the
couplets within the Ekman cores are assumed to closely approximate
varves, in which case E13 exhibits an average accumulation rate of 2.24
mm/yr. Higher accumulation rates are expected for the Ekman samples as
they are not subjected to the same level of compaction as is deeper
sediment in the long cores. The consistency of the E13 inferred
accumulation rate when compared with two of the AMS dates from the V1
and V2 cores (Figure \ref{fig:amsRates}) are additional compelling
evidence of the varved nature of the sediment record.

By comparison with nearby lakes, accumulation rates in areas proximal to
river inputs in nearby Quesnel Lake were measured to be about 0.72 mm/a
(see Figure 9 in \citet{Gilbert2012}). Sediment inputs are expected to
be lower in Quesnel Lake compared to Cariboo Lake, with more arid and
less glaciated portions of the Quesnel Lake watershed contributing to
that lower rate. The AMS accumulation rates of 1.76 +/- 0.05 mm/yr and
1.37 +/- 0.05 mm/yr in Cariboo Lake are as expected for a smaller
watershed with a higher fraction of glacier cover compared to Quesnel
Lake. The AMS radiocarbon dates from samples V1 and V2 provide an
important control when interpreting the inferred temporal pattern of
sediment inputs to Cariboo Lake.

Three distinct sediment facies were observed in both V1 and V2:
discernible couplets, indiscernible couplets (disturbed facies) and
graded turbidite events. The similarity in couplet structure and
thickness between cores V1 and V2 and the discussion of laminae
formation in Section @ref(spatial) strongly suggested these are varves.
This interpretation is supported by the two valid AMS radiocarbon dated
samples from cores V1 and V2 which corresponded reasonably well with the
couplet count chronology at the same depth. \textbf{A small difference
between the two chronologies was expected due uncertainties with each of
the chronological methods. An uncertainty estimate was quantified for
the C14 chronology (Table \ref{tab:amsDates}), however uncertainty
regarding the varve chronology was more subjective due to some isolated
sections of core with indiscernible laminations, core compaction,
undercounting, and classifying the the graded to massive laminae/beds.
Undercounting of varves may have occurred if the spring nival high flows
did not deliver a coarse-grained laminae. However, the consistent nival
flows of this basin shown in Figure \ref{fig:cl-hydro} suggest this to
be rare. Since the Ekman and long-cores did not have discernible
couplets that overlap and no distinct marker varves were observed
between V1 and V2 a varve counting uncertainty could not be determined.
The uncertainty in the Cariboo Lake varve chronology is therefore
inferred to be similar to those reported in the literature between 0.7\%
\citep{Menounos2008c} and 0.7-6\% \citep{Birlo2022}. The thick distinct
varves ranging from 1-50 mm observed in \citet{Menounos2008c} likely
contributed to the lower uncertainty while lower average accumulation
rates of (0.82-0.86 mm/yr) in \citep{Birlo2022}. \citet{Birlo2022}
attribute a core average couplet counting uncertainty of 2.5\%. Since
the Cariboo Lake long-core laminations are closer in thickness and
composition to the \citet{Birlo2022}, an uncertainty estimate of 3\% is
used for the Cariboo Lake long-cores.}

Laminae/beds with D\textsubscript{50} grain size greater than 3 standard
deviations from the mean were classified as event-based turbidite beds.
Laminae with thickness greater than 6 standard deviations for V1 and 2
standard deviations for V2 from the mean were classified as event-based
turbidite beds. Figure \ref{fig:varve-turb} examples show the difference
in regular laminae compared to an event-based turbidite bed. Turbidite
beds observed in V1 and V2 were well defined and graded (see Figure
\ref{fig:varve-turb}, d). These turbidite beds are similar in structure
to those described in \citet{sabatier2022} as originating from a flood,
glacial lake outburst flood, or delta collapse event. Since the Cariboo
River upstream of Cariboo Lake is filtered by headwater proglacial
lakes, it is more likely the turbidite beds at the distal V1 and V2 site
are from localized sidewall tributary floods. Collapse of the foreslope
of an oversteppened Cariboo delta is also possible.

Where possible the thickness, grain size statistics, and percent organic
matter (OM) were analyzed for each event layer. The turbidite bed grain
size, OM, and thickness shown in Table \ref{tab:turbTbl} illustrate the
high sediment flux during these events compared to the regular, annually
occurring couplets. The composition of sediment grains within the
event-based layers were all characterized by a coarser single mode with
less than 0.01\% clay, over 98\% silt and less than 1\% sand. The grain
size distribution for the regular couplet sediments is characterized by
a bi-modal distribution with an average composition of 16\% clay, 83\%
silt, and less than 1\% sand. Figure \ref{fig:turbScatter} shows that
some event layers are coincident in time between V1 and V2. Since each
of the event-based layers contain sediment deposited over a single,
potentially localized event, they were removed from subsequent trend
analyses of varve thickness, grain size, and percent organics. After
removal, the long core sediment records are thought to be most
representative of watershed wide trends in river discharge influenced by
temperature and precipitation rather than isolated events and inputs
from nearby tributaries and hillslopes.

\end{figure}

The varve-based chronology is based on the counting of discernible
couplets with graded turbidite facies removed. Indiscernible couplets in
the disturbed-massive units makes interpreting the time elapsed over
each of these units difficult (see Figure \ref{fig:varve-turb} C). To
compensate for the depth intervals associated with the disturbed
sections, a 30-year moving average of sediment accumulation rates from
immediately above and below the disturbed sections were used to
interpolate accumulation rates over each facies (see method described in
Menounos et al., 2008). For core V1, laminae couplets were counted down
to a core depth of 343 cm, where the AMS radiocarbon organic material
was retrieved. \textbf{This resulted in a V1 couplet-derived age
estimated of 1419 +/- 43 varve BP compared to the two-sigma calibrated
age range of 1918‐1820 cal BP. For core V2 a date of 1792 +/- 55 varve
BP was estimated by couplet counting down to a core depth of 281 cm
which matches more closely with the V2 AMS radiocarbon date of 2043-1895
cal BP. The better alignment between the couplet counting age and the
AMS derived age in V2 can be attributed to the higher degree of core
disturbance in V1 compared to V2. Disturbed sections that had
indiscernible couplets may have resulted in the undercounting within
core V1. Still, based on the relatively close agreement between the AMS
radiocarbon dated organic material and couplet counting, laminae
couplets in V1 and V2 are considered to be deposited annually. Alignment
closer than the observed offset at V1 was not expected due to the
uncertainty in the C14 and varve based chronology. The varve estimate at
V2 is nearly within the uncertainty range of the calibrated C14 age and
therefore shows good agreement between the varve and C14 chronologies.}

The basal age for each core is estimated using both the varve and using
a linear interpolation to extrapolate the C14 chronology. The basal age
of V1 at 378 cm is approximately 1537 +/- 46 varve yr BP based on the
varve chronology and the two-sigma calibrated C14 range is 2124-2016 cal
BP. The basal age of V2 at 282 cm is about 1797 +/- 54 varve yr BP based
on the varve chronology and the two-sigma calibrated C14 range is
2050-1902 cal BP. Accumulation rates estimated from the average varve
thickness and the C14 chronology had a larger difference at V1 with 2.4
+/- 0.01 mm/yr and 1.78 +/- 0.05 mm/yr, respectively. Closer agreement
was observed at V2 with 1.52 mm/yr estimated using the couplet counting
method and 1.41 +/- 0.05 mm/yr from the AMS radiocarbon date. The closer
alignment of the C14 and varve chronology at V2 gives greater confidence
in the timing of Holocene sedimentation patterns for this core. While V1
has a greater spread between the two chronology methods, we believe both
cores are valid estimates of late Holocene sediment accumulation
patterns in Cariboo Lake.

\hypertarget{sediment-accumulation-chronology-and-statistics}{%
\subsubsection{Sediment Accumulation Chronology and
Statistics}\label{sediment-accumulation-chronology-and-statistics}}

For the laminae couplet time series, shown in Figure \ref{fig:varves-a},
only the discernible couplets are analyzed, event-based turbidites have
been removed and disturbed facies are represented as gaps. The
chronologies for this time series were derived using a linear
interpolation from the AMS radiocarbon dates. The mean varve thickness
for V1 is 2.4 mm and for V2 is 1.5 mm. Thicker varves are expected at V1
due to its closer proximity to the Cariboo River delta. This is also
supported by the thicker varves observed in core E11 (proximal to V1)
compared to E13 (proximal to V2) of 2.8 mm to 2.0 mm respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:varves-a} shows the time series of varve thickness
measured from V1 and V2 and illustrates trends in suspended sediment
delivery to Cariboo Lake. The measured couplet thicknesses in the two
cores are plotted as standardized departures to facilitate comparison
between the two cores. In each plot a 30-year moving average with a
1-year time step is plotted in black to emphasize decadal to centennial
patterns in accumulation rate departures. The 30-year average varve
thickness remains above average from 0 to 750 CE, for both V1 and V2,
with a stronger signal observed for V1 which is closer to the main
Cariboo River outlet. Below average varve thickness is observed at both
V1 and V2 from 750-1600 CE. After 1600 CE, trends in varve thickness
between the two cores depart, with V2 above average during the Little
Ice Age and V1 remains below average. Sub-centennial trends are not
reported due to the coarse temporal control for both V1 and V2.

The mean D\textsubscript{50} grain size at V1 is 7.6 +/- 0.01 µm
compared to 6.3 +/- 0.01 µm at V2. The larger grain size and varve
thickness at V1 compared to V2 is consistent with the spatial trends in
sediment delivery observed from the Ekman cores. While based on a
limited number of measurements compared to the varve thickness analysis,
the temporal pattern in standardized departures of D\textsubscript{50}
grain size between the two cores shows a consistent pattern (Figure
\ref{fig:particle}). Both V1 and V2 have above average grain size
between 0 to 700 CE and below average from 700 to 1500 CE. After 1500
CE, grain size follows an increasing trend with average to above average
grain size. V1 shows a more dramatic increase in grain size compared to
V2. While couplet thickness does not increase substantially over the LIA
interval, gain size does. Overall, grain size fluctuations at a temporal
resolution of about 100-years shows good correspondence between the two
cores over the last 2000 years.

\paragraph{Organic Matter}\label{organic-matter}}

The whole core average OM content at V1 and V2 is similar at 4.76\% and
4.80\%, respectively, suggesting that the flux of allochthonous organic
material to the core locations is not dependent on distance from the
main Cariboo River as it is easily transported through the lake due to
low density. This is also supported by the Ekman OM spatial analysis,
where a systematic down-lake relationship was not observed (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, C). Figure \ref{fig:loi} shows the percent organic
matter (OM) for both V1 and V2. Higher levels of organic content are
shown in V1 and V2 from 0-1000 CE and mostly below average from
1000-2000 CE. Specific periods of above average OM for V1 occur around
CE 50-500, 650-1150, around 1300 and 1750-1850. OM in V2 matches above
average values in the interval CE 250-550 and 650-950. During the last
100 years both cores show a persistent decline in OM which could be
attributed to a relative increase in sediment delivery to Cariboo Lake
suggested by the increase in D\textsubscript{50} and varve thickness.
\textbf{As glaciers declined from peak LIA extents around 1750 CE, an
increase in soil development, vegetation growth and subsequent bank
stability is expected which may also contribute to a decline in OM as
organic content is locked up as needleleaf coniferous forest.}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Cariboo Lake was selected to test the utility of moderate sized
glacier-fed lakes as archives of accessible long-term and
high-resolution sedimentation input variability. Evidence of late
Pleistocene deglaciation in the Cariboo Lake region is provided by
coarse temporal resolution sub-bottom acoustic results. A maximum
deglacial sediment thickness of \textasciitilde35 m puts Cariboo Lake in
the middle to lower range of Holocene sediment inputs in Canadian
Cordilleran lakes \citep[see detailed discussion in][]{Gilbert2012}. The
study of smaller Mud Lake, in the Rocky Mountains to the east of Cariboo
Lake (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin} -- inset) was evaluated by
\citet{Hodder2006b}, who found the early phases of deglaciation and lake
sediment infill started just prior to 9.6 ka BP. \citet{Gilbert2012}
indicate deglaciation of the north and west arms of nearby Quesnel Lake
was likely complete by 8.6 ka BP. \citet{Menounos2009b} pointed to the
deglaciation of most of the Cordilleran ice sheet before 10.5 ka BP. The
Cariboo Lake acoustic results contribute to this regional record however
the inferred bottom dates present uncertainty in the actual timing.

Unlike many other deglacial sediment packages in Canadian Cordilleran
lakes, the sediment infill in Cariboo Lake has been subject to deep
trenching during deglaciation and the early Holocene (Figure 3c). The
troughs, with sediment infills occurring at different times, suggest the
presence of highly erosive but intermittent bottom currents during
deglaciation and into the very earliest Holocene. Energetic flow of cold
sediment-rich meltwater flow would be required suggesting proximity of
an actively retreating valley glacier. The absence of lower elevations
moraines in the valley upstream of Cariboo Lake might indicate rapidly
retreating ice into headwater locations. However, in general, moraines
indicative of stagnant ice fronts in lower elevation settings are not
common elsewhere throughout much of the eastern Cordillera suggesting
that valley glacier development was limited \citep{Menounos2009b}.

In contemporary ice-proximal lakes with extensive coverage of active
glaciers, high accumulation rates have been observed to be between 0.5
m/a \citep{Crookshanks2008} and as high as 1 m/a \citep{Gilbert1997}.
Similar high accumulation rates in the late-glacial are inferred to have
occurred in Quesnel Lake \citep{Gilbert2012}, resulting in a thick
pre-Holocene sediment package. This evidence for high pre/early Holocene
accumulation rates in Quesnel Lake from large dynamic glaciers suggests
that high accumulation rates are also likely for Cariboo Lake during
this time and is supported by the acoustic data presented here.

Sub-bottom acoustic records from Transect B shown in Figure
\ref{fig:acoustics}, which is proximal to the V1 core, indicate an
upward transition from massive-unlayered (Facies A) to well-layered
sediments (Facies B) at a depth of about 20 m. Assuming a maximum
Holocene sediment accumulation rate of approximate 1.9 mm/yr from V1,
this would put this transition at about 10.5 ka BP. The massive
structure of Facies A is inferred to be due to high rates of sediment
delivery as glaciers retreated upvalley during the early Holocene after
the formation of the deep trenches. The well-layered sediment of Facies
B, along with the continuation of laminae couplets observed in cores V1
and V2 over the last 2 ka, suggests that glaciers reduced in extent at
the start of the Holocene but did not disappear completely. It is
possible during this transition from Facies A to B, glaciers retreated
above Lanezi Lake resulting in a more sediment filtering and thus a
reduction in sediment delivery and the beginning of seasonally derived
laminae couplet formation within Cariboo Lake.

Transect C, shown in Figure \ref{fig:acoustics} is located in-between
cores V1 and V2, has \textasciitilde15 m of well layered sediment
overlying a massive unlayered lower Facies A. Using a combined V1 and V2
average Holocene sediment accumulation rate of 1.7 mm/yr in this region
of the lake, puts the transition from Facies A to B at around 9 ka BP,
slightly later than the Transect B estimate. However, sediment
accumulation rates is generally lower across western Canada prior to the
Neoglacial, due to widespread glacial activity and warm temperature
during the early Holocene
\citep{Steinman2019, Menounos2004, Koch2007a, Osborn2007, Luckman1988, Luckman1993}.
Therefore, the estimated basal ages of Facies A and B, estimated from
sedimentation rates over the last 2 ka from the long cores presented
here, may be much older if the actual sedimentation rates were used. The
timing of the transition between these two facies is similar to the
onset of deglaciation and start of the Holocene sediment package within
Mud Lake, BC \citep{Hodder2006b} around 9.6 ka BP, at Moose Lake, BC
\citep{Desloges1999} around 10.3 ka BP, at Quesnel Lake, BC
\citep{Gilbert2012} around 8.6 ka BP, and at the Upper Bow River, AB
\citep{Leonard1999} around 11.7 ka BP. Warming in the early Holocene,
around 9.10-6.70 ka BP in the Canadian Rockies, specifically,
\citep{Luckman1986} and British Columbia, generally,
\citep{Clague1989, Steinman2019} led to two possible sedimentation
regimes. Where glaciers persist in the Canadian Rockies through the warm
period resulting in more regular seasonality of sediment inputs and
laminae couplet formation \citep[e.g.~Mud Lake,][]{Hodder2006b} and
where glaciers disappear during the warm period, leading to much lower
accumulation and seasonality \citep[e.g.~Moose Lake,][]{Desloges1999}.

Records of sub-bottom acoustic records from Cariboo Lake present coarse
temporal scale resolution of continuous sedimentation rates throughout
the Holocene. Higher resolution AMS dated sediments from the much
thinner sediment package in the west arm of Quesnel Lake, located in the
Cariboo Mountains (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}), also showed a very
consistent mean rate of sedimentation throughout the entire Holocene
\citep{Gilbert2012}. Contrasting somewhat from this pattern are results
from \citet{Menounos2004} and \citet{Desloges1999} who note that early
to mid-Holocene sediment accumulation rates in the southeastern Canadian
Cordillera were lower than the late-Holocene Neoglacial period. However,
those shifts come from watersheds with much higher percentages of
glacier ice cover (\textasciitilde15-40\%) coupled with the probable
disappearance of glaciers during the warmer hypsithermal. Therefore, any
extrapolation of timing to the early sediment record of Cariboo Lake
remains speculative.

Sediment inputs to Cariboo Lake are mainly delivered via the Cariboo
River delta and thus changes in watershed-wide temperature and
precipitation trends would be expected to be important. In contrast,
inputs of sediment from the small tributary watersheds that boarder
Cariboo Lake are controlled by more localized, watershed-specific
responses. Although coarser grained sediments from discrete turbidite
flows are found proximal to sidewall tributary deltas (Figure
\ref{fig:ekmanSeds}), they are only transferred to deep lake deposits
during episodic events (Figure \ref{fig:turbScatter}). The long core (V1
and V2) sediment is composed of nearly 99\% silt and clay resulting in
laminae couplets that are inferred to have been delivered via suspended
sediment from the main Cariboo River. Therefore, trends observed in
sediment accumulation at cores V1 and V2 likely best represent
waterside-wide climate and glacier activity.

While cores V1 and V2 do not produce identical results, it is likely the
sediment yield data from these cores are within the range of 7-21\%
error reported in Evans and Church (2000) for other alpine lakes in
British Columbia. The inferred error of cores V1 and V2 is attributed to
the spatial heterogeneity of sediment accumulation across the Cariboo
Lake, and is likely on the lower end of this error range due to its
simple basin morphology. Retrieving more than two good long core
sedimentary sequences, could have provided a better estimate in the
error of sediment accumulation, however, the logistical demands of
retrieving more cores prevented this.

There is a documented range of late Holocene clastic sediment
accumulation rates in glacier-fed lakes from across the Canadian
Cordillera. Highest rates of \textgreater{} 2 cm/yr are observed in
ice-contact to ice-proximal lakes of various sizes
\citep{Desloges1994d, Crookshanks2008}, to relatively low rates of
\textless{} 1 mm/yr \citep{Gilbert2012}. The range in accumulation rates
has been understood to be a result in the variability of sediment
production from glacier processes, the steepness of topography
\citep{Ballantyne2002}, the persistence of ice cover and the degree of
basin connectivity enhancing or impeding delivery of sediment down
valley \citep{Wohl2019}.

In the Cariboo Lake basin, the combination of upper watershed area,
intervening storage, glacier cover and lake size are considered optimal
during this period for the relatively consistent formation of clastic
varves. The Cariboo River has two main tributaries, the Upper Cariboo
River and the Matthew River which are connected to high alpine peaks and
glaciers providing a significant source of sediment (see Figure 2).
Lanezi, Sandy and Ghost lakes act as sediment traps eliminating the
transfer of coarse sediment and limiting the transfer of finer sediment
from the glacier sediment production zones. This results in sediment
accumulation rates that are on the low-end for the southeastern
Cordillera \citep{Hodder2006b}. Although connectivity is limited, there
are sufficient seasonal contrasts in suspended sediment flux to produce
couplets (annual varves) in the main basin of Cariboo Lake over the last
two millennia. This is unlike the west arm of Quesnel Lake where
sediment rates are 2 to 3 times lower due to significant storage in the
much larger upper watershed.

Lake sediment chronologies typically vary in their sensitivity to
regional fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, from annual
resolution in lakes with higher accumulation rates
\citep[e.g.][]{Menounos2008c} to centennial-scale in lakes with low
accumulation rates \citep[e.g.][]{Desloges1999}. Figure
\ref{fig:proxy-comparison}a shows the (inferred) varve thickness
chronology reconstructed as standardized departures from cores V1 and
V2. There is a significant amount of noise in the record, typical of a
filtered sediment transport system \citep[e.g.][]{Jerolmack2010}, so a
lower resolution 30-year moving average is superimposed on the raw
couplet thickness data in Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}a. Figure
\ref{fig:proxy-comparison}b and \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}c show the
lower-resolution temporal patterns in D\textsubscript{50} grain size and
organic matter content, respectively. These trends are compared against
the \citet{Moberg2005} regional climate proxy re-analysis for the
northern hemisphere (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}d),
\citet{Solomina2016} western Canada peak glacier extent estimates
(Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}e), and \citet{Ljungqvist2016}
hydroclimate anomaly estimates for the northern hemisphere (Figure
\ref{fig:proxy-comparison}f). Most of these are at resolutions of
centennial scale or lower.

\textbf{For Cariboo Lake, above average varve thickness, grain size, and
organic matter are observed for both V1 and V2 from 0-700 CE. The
advance and retreat of glaciers during the First Millennium advance
around 200-500 CE is reported in the Coast Mountains \citep{Allen2007},
Rocky Mountains
\citep{Luckman1995, Luckman1999, Dirszowsky1997a, Leonard1999}, and more
broadly across western Canada \citep{Solomina2016}. The increase in
sediment production and availability in the system may be reflected here
by the increase in varve thickness and grain size in the Cariboo Lake
record (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}). Observations of an increase
in clastic sedimentation rates were also observed at 200 CE in Hector
Lake \citep{Leonard1997} and in Banff National Park \citep{Leonard1999}.
Above average grain size and varve thickness are expected during a time
of increased glacier extent due to higher rates of sediment production
and delivery. However, the above average organic matter observed in
Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison} is atypical during an increase of
clastic sediment delivery, but could be explained by some contribution
of increased soil erosion below treeline during a time of higher
precipitation rates and subsequent high spring freshet flows.}

\textbf{As temperatures warmed in the Pacific Northwest
\citep{Steinman2012} and Northern Hemisphere \citep{Moberg2005} into the
Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), a general glacier retreat phase is
reported by \citet{Solomina2016} from 700-900 CE across western Canada
(Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}, E). In the Cariboo Lake record, a
decline in varve thickness and grain size is observed from 700-800 CE
for both V1 and V2. Following this glacier retreat Although there is
evidence of an early Little Ice Age (LIA) glacier advance centering
around 1250 CE \citep{Luckman1995, Osborn2001, Leonard1997} the response
is not present in V1 and V2 (\ref{fig:proxy-comparison}). The second
glacier advance of the LIA, which centers around 1850 CE
\citep{Luckman2000e, Leonard1997} coincides with thicker and coarser
varves, and reduction in organic matter (\ref{fig:proxy-comparison}).
The change in varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter begins
earlier for V1 at around 1750 CE compared to V2 which begins to change
around 1825 CE. The discrepancy in the sediment characteristic trends
between the two cores is considered small considering the uncertainty in
the dating control of this study. Overall, the response of varve
thickness, grain size, and organic matter to the second advance of the
LIA around 1850 CE exhibits a stronger response compared earlier
advances of the LIA. Temperature anomalies for the Northern Hemisphere
reported by \citet{Moberg2005}, are also most negative from 1500-1750
CE. In \citet{Steinman2012}, dryer conditions from 1600-1900 are
observed 500 km south of Cariboo Lake in Castor and Lime Lakes likely
associated with colder temperatures. These records suggest how dramatic
the LIA was compared to the rest of the 2 ka record. Following the LIA,
around 2000 CE a dramatic decline in organic matter and increase in
grain size is observed suggestive of high magnitude clastic sediment
delivery. This could be attributed to the increase of sediment
availability as glaciers retreated from LIA extents and exposed stores
of clastic sediments \citep{Beedle2015}. However, hydraulic mining
practices during the Cariboo Gold Rush and deforestation began during
the late 1800s and may have contributed to these anomalies. This limits
conclusions that increased glacier retreat observed in the Cariboo
Mountains due to 20\textsuperscript{th} century warming
\citep{Beedle2015} is the main cause.}

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The moderated-sized Cariboo Lake provides a very good record of
deglacial and Holocene sediment inputs for central British Columbia. The
steep climatic gradient from the wetter, glacier covered, headwaters to
the semi-arid, lower elevation zones of the lake, result in sediment
input via the main Cariboo Lake delta that is predominately derived from
the glacier production zone. This conclusion is supported by the
down-lake trends observed in grain-size and organic matter content. The
smaller alluvial-fan deltas from side tributaries appear to be
paraglacial relic features, similar to those described in
\citet{Church1972}, and likely formed during deglaciation and the
earliest Holocene as no evidence of significant inputs during the
Holocene were found in this study.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sub-bottom acoustic records provide a coarse temporal resolution
  chronology of early and mid-Holocene sediment accumulation.
  \textbf{The transition of massive to well-layered sediments is
  estimated to have occurred around 10.5 to 9 ka BP. There is
  uncertainty with chronology of this transition as sediment
  accumulation rates from the 2 ka sediment cores were extrapolated to
  10 ka BP.} Still, the 10.5 to 9 ka BP transition is similar to other
  glacier, lake and climate records across British Columbia and Alberta
  and suggests fairly consistent and rapid withdrawal of valley-bottom
  glacier ice into the highest elevation zones.
\item
  There are still limitations in the ability to retrieve sufficiently
  long cores (\textgreater{} 10-15 m), that would provide a high
  resolution record of sediment inputs over the entire Holocene. If
  trends observed in other southern Canadian Cordilleran lakes prevail,
  the early and mid-Holocene input of sediment during the hypsithermal
  would have been significantly reduced resulting in a Holocene sediment
  package within the 10-15 m range. Acoustic Facies B most likely
  represents this unit.
\item
  Sedimentary structures in the long cores indicated sediment delivery
  over the late Holocene to present is dominated by similar fractions of
  silt (spring freshet) and clay (winter settling) resulting in the
  formation of rhythmically laminated couplets that are mainly varves.
  \textbf{Overflow currents in Cariboo Lake are inferred to be the
  dominant delivery mechanism of fine clastic sediments compared to
  other lakes in the Canadian Cordillera which typically have a larger
  fraction of coarse sediment from more frequent fall or spring high
  flows.} While there is relatively close agreement between sediment
  chronology from laminae counting and the two AMS dates, it is not
  possible to develop a chronology that provides a precisely dated
  sediment yield record over the last 2 ka. However, the observed mean
  accumulation rate (1.7 mm/yr), the variance in accumulation rate and
  the low-frequency trends are important indicators of late Holocene
  environmental change.
\item
  Periods of peak glacier extent, such as during the First Millennial
  Advance (\textasciitilde{} 200 to 700 CE) and Little Ice Age
  (\textasciitilde1600 to 1900 CE) are correlated with thicker and
  coarser varves in Cariboo Lake. We conclude that sediment accumulation
  in Cariboo Lake was more sensitive to glacier activity during the LIA
  compared to earlier advances. This is consistent with other records of
  glacier activity in the region which report a greater LIA response.
  Trends in organic matter content appear to be less correlated with
  watershed sediment delivery and may be more sensitive to vegetation
  changes in the basin.
\item
  The greatest deviation in varve thickness, grain size, and organic
  matter above normal occurs after 1860 CE and may be related to climate
  warming following the LIA. However, there are complications in this
  watershed via large-scale mining proximal to the lake and some upper
  watershed deforestation. These land-use and land-cover changes may
  have also been contributing factors to an increase in sediment
  delivery to the lake.
