Comments to the Author
A note here that the submitted pdf contains an ill-formatted version of Tab=
le 1 that appears out of place on page 2. Also, two sequential versions of =
the complete manuscript are here for a total of 67 pages. For my review I c=
ite the page numbers of the first version of the manuscript, starting on th=
e title page numbered as page 3 of 65.

General: This is a well-developed study of the sedimentation patterns withi=
n a large, elongated lake basin located in a glaciated watershed of the Car=
boo mountains of southeastern British Columbia. The objectives are framed t=
o establish basin-wide mechanisms and develop a high-resolution record of s=
ediment accumulation for a paleoclimatic interpretation of the past 2000 ye=
ars. Methods include acoustic profiles, surface sediment collections and lo=
nger cores, which combine to provide a multiple proxy set of results that a=
ddress the objectives. Results are evaluated carefully within the context o=
f the local and distal watershed processes. The acoustic results are used t=
o develop an interpretive framework for the deglacial sedimentary history o=
f the basin, which is judiciously tied into the detailed varve analyses of =
the past 2000 years to the best of the ability of the chronological informa=
tion from radiocarbon and varve counts. Thus, some of the conclusions are i=
nherently limited by the method, for example the timing of deglaciation, bu=
t the regional comparisons provide a framework for making reasonable, but n=
ot yet fully proven, conclusions. The varve record is well-developed, with =
careful consideration of limitations and evaluation within a regional varve=
 framework. However, the final comparisons of the varve record with norther=
n hemisphere trends are not persuasive and will require revisions to better=
 develop the case for a hydroclimatic interpretation with regional comparis=
ons with multi-proxy lake sediment records in the study region. There is al=
so a need for decisions to be made about the prominent low-frequency differ=
ences in varve thickness trends between the two cores for the hydroclimatic=
 comparisons. The paper is well-suited for The Holocene and with the revisi=
ons to address its few weaknesses it will be of interest to researchers fro=
m a broad range of disciplines.


Title: the title has a focus on implications for Holocene watershed dynamic=
s whereas the glacial and watershed dynamics explored in the paper would be=
 more accurately described as having implications for the hydroclimatic int=
erpretation of the varve record. Consider a revision to report the paper to=
pics more accurately.

Abstract: p.4 line 2 says acoustic transects reflect the Holocene but line =
11-12 says acoustic records represent the deglacial and Holocene =E2=80=93 =
be consistent and the sentences are repetitive. Overall, the abstract could=
 be improved by beginning with =E2=80=98what=E2=80=99, which would be an ex=
planation to readers that there is 1) an acoustic record of sedimentation s=
ince deglaciation and 2) a varve record 2k in length.

Introduction:
p.5 line 4. These two sentences would read more smoothly with a transition,=
 which is a common writing problem throughout the manuscript for both sente=
nces and paragraphs. For example, after pointing out that sub-annual record=
s are used =E2=80=98across the globe=E2=80=99, the next sentence could begi=
n with a specific transition such as =E2=80=9CIn the case of sedimentary se=
quences from=E2=80=A6 glaciated watersheds, they have been important in=E2=
=80=A6=E2=80=9D The writing would be improved overall with a thorough revis=
ion of transitions.

p.5 line 23-24. I think what is meant to be conveyed here is that there is =
a reduced sensitivity to climate variability with low sedimentation rates, =
which is a primary influence on signal to noise. This point is brought up l=
ater in the manuscript but would be better spelled out here, in the introdu=
ction. A new paragraph would do well on lie 23 beginning with =E2=80=98Prev=
ious studies=E2=80=A6=E2=80=99 that could spend more time on articulating t=
he balance between sed rates and upstream filters for high signal to noise =
ratio records. Would also do well to end with a specific explanation about =
how Cariboo fits into this spectrum =E2=80=93 what exactly is the =E2=80=98=
gap=E2=80=99 and specifically how does Cariboo fill it?

p.5 line 41. More specific explanation about how acoustic profiles can be u=
sed would be helpful here, especially in this sentence that implies use for=
 temperature and precipitation reconstructions. I suspect what is meant her=
e is that the varve counts are useful for T and P. Consider more explicit w=
riting to explain that the cores are used to assess hydroclimate whereas th=
e acoustic profiles are used to assess the basin-wide sedimentation history=
.

p.6 line 10. The last objective is lacking background discussion within the=
 introduction that should include further discussion of the climate setting=
 and influences. Also more background on previous hydroclimatic reconstruct=
ions is needed here in the introduction and in the closing section of the d=
iscussion. See Steinman et al., QSR 2019 for a regional summary, including =
the impacts of the Mazama ash. It may also be worth noting if the Mazama as=
h is known to occur in lakes around the Cariboo region and if some of the r=
eflectors could be related (or not). For further background also see Rodysi=
ll et al., QSR 2018, Nelson et al., PNAS 2011 and Steinman et al., GRL 2014=
 on hydroclimatic variability, patterns, and drivers of the late Holocene i=
n northwest North America =E2=80=93 these data most accurately reflect the =
proximal conditions of Cariboo Lake which would make a much more compelling=
 argument for a hydroclimatic interpretation of the varve record than north=
ern hemisphere reconstructions which are less detailed and accurate at the =
regional scale.

Study Area:
p.6 line 18-19. Williams Lake is not identified on Figure 1 and the number =
and names of the lakes that are upstream of Cariboo would be well mentioned=
 here. A distance legend is needed on Figure 1.
p. 6 line 31. =E2=80=98ban=E2=80=99 should be =E2=80=98fan=E2=80=99
p. 6 line 32. Clarify that these are measurements of basin areas, i.e. =E2=
=80=988 km2 in surface area=E2=80=99
p. 6 line 37. Not sure if follow this statement about =E2=80=98evidence for=
 post glacial scouring=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 is this meant to imply ice scouri=
ng and a question about glacial limits?
p. 6 line 38-44. Is there any knowledge about the sediment infill of Lanezi=
 and Sandy Lakes? If so, this would be a good place to describe.

Methods:
p.7 line 46. =E2=80=98730 cm3=E2=80=99 from Ekman dredge =E2=80=93 it would=
 be useful to describe the length of the short sediment cores. To what sedi=
ment depth do the short cores extend?

p.8 line 45. What specifically is meant here by =E2=80=98best preserved=E2=
=80=99? In what sense needs to be explained.

p.9 line 7. What specifically is meant here by =E2=80=98stratigraphic break=
s=E2=80=99? Does this mean gaps within cores, between cores, both or additi=
onal types of breaks?
p.9 line 8. By =E2=80=98working cores=E2=80=99 do you mean =E2=80=98working=
 halves=E2=80=99?

Results:
p. 9 line 41-42. A little more explanation of =E2=80=98cross hatching=E2=80=
=99 is needed here to direct the reader=E2=80=99s attention to the figure a=
nd explaining that this refers to the diagonal lines across all panels. Thi=
s is not immediately obvious.

p. 10 line 22. Not sure what is meant here by the =E2=80=98record is cut of=
f=E2=80=99. In what manner and why?

p.12 line 10. Suggest new paragraph beginning here with =E2=80=98The two bu=
ried troughs=E2=80=A6=E2=80=99
p.12 line 14-15. It would be very helpful if the =E2=80=98wedge of sediment=
=E2=80=99 were indicated on Figure 3C to help readers recognize that it is =
not clearly part of facies A.
p.12 line 36. It is not clear in what way specifically that the Frank Creek=
 delta is =E2=80=98different=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 clarify.

p. 13 line 23-27. Define D50, D90, and D10 in descriptive sedimentary terms=
 for a broader audience (ie., sand, silt, clay).=20
p.13 line 41. Using percent clay, silt and sand is the most accessible way =
of describing this data to a broad audience and I suggest that it be used t=
hroughout and on the figures.

p. 14 line 27. Revise =E2=80=98well-preserved=E2=80=99 to =E2=80=98distinct=
 laminations=E2=80=99 throughout - it is introduced later but is a more spe=
cifically descriptive term. In Fig 5 both E13 and E18 look =E2=80=98well-pr=
eserved=E2=80=99 the difference has to do with the clarity of the laminatio=
ns.
p. 14 line 43-44. This interpretation has been made earlier and this explan=
ation should be moved upward in the manuscript for the first time it is use=
d.

p. 15 line 45. Is the lower %OM here in related to dilution by higher clast=
ic flux? Clarify.

p. 16 line 3. To be most accurate, consider changing =E2=80=98suggest that=
=E2=80=99 here to =E2=80=98supports the hypothesis that=E2=80=99=20

p. 16 line 30. =E2=80=98prevented finding ash=E2=80=99 here is based on loo=
king for what? A visual color change, and/or in grain size and/or microscop=
ic examination for volcanic glass?
p. 16 line 31-32. To be most clear, consider changing the start of the sent=
ence that begins with =E2=80=98Records=E2=80=A6=E2=80=99 to  =E2=80=98The c=
hronology of the Cariboo lake core records of grain size=E2=80=A6=E2=80=99
p. 16 line 40. Report AMS radiocarbon ages in 14C years with measured error=
 range and the version of Calib used to calibrate the ages. A table of chro=
nological data is advised.

p. 17 line 20-21. Or the large piece of wood possibly settled into the sedi=
ments due to its weight.
p. 17 line 23. A transition to this new paragraph is needed. Suggest =E2=80=
=9CBy comparison with nearby lakes=E2=80=A6=E2=80=99
p. 17 line 28-30. This reasoning is not clear =E2=80=93 are these estimates=
 based on a smaller Cariboo watershed size because of more glacial ice? How=
 was this done?
p. 17 line 36-37. Core disturbances should be described in the methods sect=
ion explaining the type of disturbance and the core depths where it occurs.
p. 17 line 40. At this point some discussion of varve counting uncertainty =
estimates would be helpful =E2=80=93 it shows up on p. 18 but should be ear=
lier =E2=80=93 suggest reorganizing this section and that this information =
be compiled in a table of chronological data.
p. 17 line 41. Here is =E2=80=98discernable couplets=E2=80=99 etc., which s=
hould also appear earlier in the paper.

p. 19 line 40-42. This point would be better placed in the discussion in a =
section focused on the rationale for the hydroclimatic interpretation.

p. 21 line 4. The use of =E2=80=98indiscernible couplets=E2=80=99 would be =
better used here.
p. 21 line 24. Being more specific here would be more information such as =
=E2=80=98Alignment closer than the observed ~500 year offset was not expect=
ed=E2=80=99.
p. 21 line 27-37. Again, a table of ages with varve dates and sed rates wit=
h errors is advisable to make this information easier to digest.

p. 23 line 44. Also soil development and stability

Discussion:
p. 25 line 46. Reference needed for lack of moraine evidence for stagnant i=
ce fronts.

p. 26 line 6-7. Transition to paragraph is needed and consider changing to =
=E2=80=98extensive watershed coverage by glaciers=E2=80=99
p. 26 line 13. Is the =E2=80=98high accumulation rates are also likely for =
Cariboo lakes during this time=E2=80=99 based on the massive character indi=
cated by the acoustic data?
p. 26 line 15. Suggest adding =E2=80=98Northern=E2=80=99 to =E2=80=98Rockie=
s=E2=80=99 because warming is earlier in central Rockies. Also, this paragr=
aph could be integrated with above paragraph more concisely.
p. 26 line 17. Is =E2=80=98where glaciers persist=E2=80=99 referring to Car=
iboo Lake? If yes, this would be good to say directly.
All of page 26 could be revised to develop the arguments more clearly and c=
oncisely.

p. 27 line 17. Rather than =E2=80=98So=E2=80=99, consider =E2=80=98Therefor=
e=E2=80=99
p. 27 line 22-23. Rather than =E2=80=98would be important=E2=80=99, conside=
r =E2=80=98would be expected to be important=E2=80=99. This paragraph is to=
o long, loses focus, and the point is not clear. Requires revision to impro=
ve argument and make a clear point.

p. 28 line 21. =E2=80=98Ideal=E2=80=99 in what way?
p. 28 line 26. By =E2=80=98Actual=E2=80=99 do you mean the existing core da=
ta show this? Requires clarification.
p. 28 line 31. By saying the Cariboo Lake record is =E2=80=98very high reso=
lution=E2=80=99, do you also mean by comparison with the records just descr=
ibed? Suggest revision.
p. 28 line 40. Unclear why the comparisons with regional data is lacking. A=
n extensive amount of information is available.

Figure 12 needs an x-axis label =E2=80=98Age CE=E2=80=99

p. 29 lines 2-4. The way this sentence begins with =E2=80=98While=E2=80=99 =
is unclear and it does not make sense.
p. 29. lines 10-16. Although the varve thicknesses decline in both V1 and V=
2 over the Medieval Climate Anomaly (which I suggest MWP be changed to), th=
ey increase again during the LIA only in V2. While the differences in the t=
wo cores was discussed earlier it needs to be brought back again into this =
comparison to clarify why the trend is V2 is the =E2=80=98correct=E2=80=99 =
one for comparison as this explanation implies.
p. 29 lines 17-27. This section is too brief, casual, and speculative =E2=
=80=93 see comments above about need for more comprehensive regional compar=
ison. Remove =E2=80=98tempting=E2=80=99 and consider the influence of land =
cover and land use change more thoroughly.

Conclusions:
Point 1. Age of massive to laminated transition from acoustic data is an es=
timate and this should be made very clear here.
Point 3. Overflow currents are only lightly discussed and if they are going=
 to feature as a major conclusion there should be more attention to them. A=
 regional comparison is needed to argue for hydroclimatic sensitivity more =
persuasively.

Comments to the Author
The authors present an ~2k year long lake sediment-based record of glacier =
variability in the northern Rockies along with seismic and sediment core tr=
ansect data from Cariboo lake, British Columbia. There is a substantial amo=
unt of high quality data in the paper and thorough characterization of the =
sedimentology of the Cariboo Lake basin. The paper is generally very well w=
ritten and organized, with high quality figures. I do however have some con=
cerns that will likely require moderate (arguably major) revision to the pa=
per. My main problem lies with how the age model data are presented and dis=
cussed and with how the age model was assembled. I also have concerns with =
how the varve thickness data are interpreted in the context of climate chan=
ge as it influences glacier variability. My main comments/questions/ recomm=
ended edits appear below, but there are smaller edits not listed below that=
 appear in the attached pdf. I feel that my concerns can all be addressed w=
ith a round or two of revisions, and I would be happy to review a revised v=
ersion of the paper.

Comments

Introduction 1st paragraph: This paragraph is very long and should be broke=
n up into smaller more focused paragraphs.

Page 3 =E2=80=93 Line 39: This is repeated in the next section so delete he=
re. Same for the lake surface area 10 km2.

Study Area: There should be basic information about the climate of the regi=
on here. A table showing monthly precipitation/temperature would be helpful=
, or at least a description of the seasonality of precip/temp. Reanalysis p=
roducts or station data - if available - could be used for this.

Page 7 =E2=80=93 Lines 7-9: What is the uncertainty estimate on the layer c=
ounting if any?

Page 7 =E2=80=93 Lines 23-26: What calibration software and calibration cur=
ve was applied?

Figure 3 caption: See attached pdf.

Page 10 =E2=80=93 Lines 42-43: I don't think distances are long enough for =
this to be relevant given you are talking about sediment entering along the=
 short axis of the lake. Distance of many km are required for Coriolis to b=
e meaningful beyond the scale of a meter or two. It seems more likely that =
nearshore currents would be responsible for this.

Page 14 =E2=80=93 Chronology: More information needs to be presented on the=
 chronology data. The 14C age and analytical uncertainty should be provided=
, along with the calibrated median age and 2 sigma range. There's also no m=
ention of the calibration curve used to produce these ages which makes me q=
uestion whether they are in fact calibrated ages. This information should b=
e summarized in a table.

It's difficult to assess the quality of the presented age estimates without=
 this information.

Page 14 =E2=80=93 Line 40: What are these ranges? Is this the max and min 2=
sigma range? Please clarify. Also is this calendar years BP or calibrated y=
ears? I assume the former.

Page 14 - Line 20: Was the sample collected from the outermost edge of the =
core, i.e. was it touching the core barrel? If so then it should not be use=
d, and you could make a case that it should not have been analyzed in the f=
irst place and thus doesn't need to be presented. If it was not touching th=
e edge of the corer, then it's not possible that the corer pushed it to a l=
ower depth, in which case the older age is much harder to explain.

Page 15 =E2=80=93 end of 2nd paragraph: This is the point I expected to see=
 the age models presented as figures. I recommend showing depth on the y-ax=
is and age on the x-axis. Show the varved based chronologies and the 14C ag=
es. This would make it much easier to assess the chronologies for the cores=
.

Page 15 =E2=80=93 line 40: I'm not sure what you mean by this. Please clari=
fy.

Page 16 =E2=80=93 lines 31-35: It's difficult to assess the quality of the =
chronology with the data that is presented and because of how the data are =
presented. Please see comments above about 14C data requirements and includ=
ing age model figures (depth vs age).=20

Also you mention undercounting here. How much uncertainty does this contrib=
ute? This should be mentioned in the methods and discussed in the results.

Also I was expecting by now for the varve formation mechanism to have been =
discussed, but maybe that comes later. How did/do the varves form? What is =
the exact process that leads to their formation?

Page 17 =E2=80=93 Lines 36-42: I agree with this approach, but the chronolo=
gy data need to be more thoroughly presented/discussed.

Page 19 =E2=80=93 Line 13: cal right?

Page 19 =E2=80=93 Lines 25-26: What are the errors in the counting method? =
How much do they potentially affect the accuracy? I think these are probabl=
y varves, but I'm not convinced at this point.

Page 19 =E2=80=93 Lines 30-32:  The problem with extrapolating is that you =
are using only presumably the median age. What does the sed rate / age mode=
l look like if you use the 2 sigma high and low calibrated 14C ages? The ac=
tual sed rate is very likely somewhere within this range. Keep in mind also=
 the farther you get from the 14C age the greater the uncertainty (number o=
f years separating the high and low sed rate age models).=20

Also This is really good agreement. I need more info on the 14C age, but th=
e varve age appears to be within, or nearly, the uncertainty range of the 1=
4C ages. If that's the case I would stress that point.

Page 19 =E2=80=93 Lines 38-40: Probably this is true. But without better de=
monstration of valid chronology we can't be sure. Include age model figures=
 that show depth vs age with locations of turbidites (or instantaneous depo=
sits) marked along with sections where ages were estimated based on varve b=
ased sed rates above and below. The figure(s) should also show the 14C ages=
 and the age models based on the 14C ages including the extrapolated ages. =
The extrapolated 14C ages should include uncertainty based on use of the 2s=
igma high and low ages (i.e. 3 age models - one based on the median 14C age=
, and 1 for each 2sig hi and lo). Another option is to use age model softwa=
re like bacon or bchron and show the output of this along with the varve ch=
ronologies. I think this would strengthen the paper tremendously and make t=
his statement conclusive.

Page 19 =E2=80=93 Line 46: the median age?

Figure 11 caption: See pdf for highlighted text. median age? 2sigma error?

Discussion =E2=80=93 last paragraph: Why exactly do you think it was drier =
during MCA? Are the glaciers in the catchment controlled by precipitation a=
mounts more so than temperature? Isn't it possible the warmer temperatures =
raised the ELA, reduced glacier size and snowpack amounts and thus reduced =
sed delivery into the lake?

What evidence is there that it was wetter during LIA? It's possible the coo=
ler temps allowed glaciers/snow pack to expand and produce greater sed deli=
very.=20

There is nuance regarding glacier responses to temp/precip that needs to be=
 explored before you can say that this record of glacier activity reflects =
specific combinations of climate variable changes though time.

Conclusion point #3: Maybe I missed it but I didn't catch a description of =
this mechanism in the discussion. Make sure it's in there.

Conclusion - last paragraph: A stronger concluding statement is warranted. =
Finish with the main point that you want to make here - that the Cariboo La=
ke record provides insight on glacier activity changes over the last 2000 y=
ears at a very high resolution relative to other available records and thus=
 warrants further study to produce xyz result. Or something like that.
