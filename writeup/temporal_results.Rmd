Four glaciolacustrine sediment cores, which range from 2 â€“ 4 m in length, were retrieved from the deepest basins of Cariboo Lake (Fig. 1). Cores V1 and V2 were selected for detailed analysis as these two cores had sufficient organic material for AMS radiocarbon chronology, and their sedimentary record was well preserved. Records of grain size, varve thickness, and organic content from these two cores demonstrate patterns in sediment delivery to Cariboo Lake over the past 1500 years. 

*Chronology*

AMS radiocarbon dates obtained for cores V1 and V2 (Table 1) provide temporal control and evidence of sediment accumulation rates. A small twig from V1 at 347 cm yielded a date of 1899-1819 cal BP. Two separate samples were analyzed from V2, one comprised of a large twig at 222 cm yielding a date of 490-316 cal BP (V2a), and a combination of two separate organic pieces which were combined into one sample, a twig at 286 cm and a pine needle at 294 cm and provided a date of 2045-1895 cal BP (V2b). Figure 2, shows the dating calibration curves derived for the three AMS radiocarbon dates. The date provided for sample V2a, yields a sedimentation rate of 5.51 mm/yr, which is much higher, relative to the rates of 1.87 and 1.45 mm/yr provided for V1 and V2b respectively. Additional sedimentation rates derived from the Ekman surficial cores 13-15 are shown in Fig. 3, which are proximal to the V2 core (see Fig. 1), and exhibit sedimentation rates of 2.24, 2.52, and 2.31 mm/yr respectively. The consistency of the EK13-15 sedimentation rates with the V1 and V2b AMS sedimentation rate, suggests that the V2a sample may have been pulled down during the coring process due the large twig size of 4 cm resulting in a erroneously high sedimentation rate for V2a. Since no additional evidence was found to support the V2a sedimentation rate of 5.51 mm/yr, it was not included in subsequent analysis. The AMS radiocarbon dates from samples V1 and V2b, which were consistent with sedimentation rates provided by proximal Ekman surficial cores, provide an important temporal control when interpreting the following sediment analyses. Since the top section of cores V1 and V2 were disturbed, 110 cm for V1 and 70 cm at V2 they do not have a true temporal anchor of 0 yr BP at 0 cm. The AMS radiocarbon dates provide the best temporal control available for both cores.

The sediment laminae chronology from cores V1 and V2 are interpreted as annual couplets or varves. This interpretation was supported by the AMS radiocarbon dated samples from cores V1 and V2 which corresponded reasonably well with the age of the varve at the same depth. However, some error is present in the varve chronology due to the presence of disturbed sections of core, core compaction, undercounting, and subjectivity in classifying flood events. The degree of surface disturbance was larger than expected in both V1 and V2, due to the vibra coring process. This led to sections of the cores without visible laminae couples, primarily near the tops of the cores. A total of 127 cm of the core was disturbed at V1 and 75 cm was disturbed at V2. In the absence of laminae couplets in the disturbed sections, time was interpolated using a 30-year moving average sediment rate (as in Menounos et al., 2008). For core V1, laminae couplets were counted down to the core depth of 347 cm, where the AMS radiocarbon organic material was retrieved, which resulted in a varve estimated date of 1451 BP. Compared to the AMS radiocarbon estimate of 1899 - 1819 cal BP. For core V2 a date of 1886 BP was estimated by laminae couplet counting down to a core depth of 294 cm which matches up closely with the second AMS radiocarbon date of 2045-1895 cal BP of provided for V2. Based on this relatively close agreement between the AMS radiocarbon dated organic material and the varve chronology, laminae couplets at V1 and V2 are considered to be deposited annually. Close alignment was not expected due to the afformentioned error present in the varve counting methodology and the coarse resolution of the AMS radiocarbon date. 

The basal age for each core for was estimated using both the varve chronology and the AMS radiocarbon sedimentation rate. The basal age at V1 is 1622 BP based on the varve chronology and 2046 cal BP when extrapolating the AMS radiocarbon date. The basal age at V2 is 1913 BP based on the varve chronology and 2007 cal BP by extrapolating. The basal dates for these cores are only an approximation but given the relatively close agreement between the varve chronology and radiocarbon dates they are a reasonable estimate.
