Four glaciolacustrine sediment cores, which range from 2 – 4 m in length, were retrieved from the deepest basins of Cariboo Lake (Figure 1). Cores V1 and V2 were selected for detailed analysis as these two cores had sufficient organic material for AMS radiocarbon chronology, and their sedimentary record was well preserved. Records of grain size, varve thickness, and organic content from these two cores demonstrate patterns in sediment delivery to Cariboo Lake over the past 1500 years. 

*Chronology*

AMS radiocarbon dates obtained for cores V1 and V2 (Table 1) provide temporal control and evidence of sediment accumulation rates. A small twig from V1 at 347 cm yielded a date of 1899-1819 cal BP. Two separate samples were analyzed from V2, one comprised of a large twig at 222 cm yielding a date of 490-316 cal BP (V2a), and a combination of two separate organic pieces which were combined into one sample, a twig at 286 cm and a pine needle at 294 cm and provided a date of 2045-1895 cal BP (V2b). Figure 2, shows the dating calibration curves derived for the three AMS radiocarbon dates. The date provided for sample V2a, yields a sedimentation rate of 5.51 mm/yr, which is much higher, relative to the rates of 1.87 +/- 0.04 mm/yr and 1.47 +/- 0.11 mm/yr provided for V1 and V2b respectively. Additional sedimentation rates derived from the Ekman surficial cores 13-15 are shown in Figure 3, which are proximal to the V2 core (see Figure 1), and exhibit sedimentation rates of 2.24, 2.52, and 2.31 mm/yr respectively. Higher sedimentation rates are expected for the EKman samples are they are not subjected to the same level of compaction as the long cores. Still, the consistency of the EK13-15 sedimentation rates with the V1 and V2b AMS sedimentation rate, suggests that the V2a sample may have been pulled down during the coring process due the large twig size of 4 cm resulting in a erroneously high sedimentation rate for V2a. Since no additional evidence was found to support the V2a sedimentation rate of 5.51 mm/yr, it was not included in subsequent analysis. The AMS radiocarbon dates from samples V1 and V2b, which were consistent with sedimentation rates provided by proximal Ekman surficial cores, provide an important temporal control when interpreting the following sediment analyses. Since the top section of cores V1 and V2 were disturbed, 110 cm for V1 and 70 cm at V2 they do not have a true temporal anchor of 0 yr BP at 0 cm. The AMS radiocarbon dates provide the best temporal control available for both cores.

The sediment laminae chronology from cores V1 and V2 are interpreted as annual couplets or varves. This interpretation was supported by the AMS radiocarbon dated samples from cores V1 and V2 which corresponded reasonably well with the age of the varve at the same depth. However, some error is present in the varve chronology due to the presence of disturbed sections of core, core compaction, undercounting, and subjectivity in classifying flood events. The degree of surface disturbance was larger than expected in both V1 and V2, due to the vibra coring process. This led to sections of the cores without visible laminae couples, primarily near the tops of the cores. A total of 127 cm of the core was disturbed at V1 and 75 cm was disturbed at V2. In the absence of laminae couplets in the disturbed sections, time was interpolated using a 30-year moving average sediment rate (as in Menounos et al., 2008). For core V1, laminae couplets were counted down to the core depth of 347 cm, where the AMS radiocarbon organic material was retrieved, which resulted in a varve estimated date of 1451 BP. Compared to the AMS radiocarbon estimate of 1899 - 1819 cal BP. For core V2 a date of 1886 BP was estimated by laminae couplet counting down to a core depth of 294 cm which matches up closely with the second AMS radiocarbon date of 2045-1895 cal BP of provided for V2. Based on this relatively close agreement between the AMS radiocarbon dated organic material and the varve chronology, laminae couplets at V1 and V2 are considered to be deposited annually. Close alignment was not expected due to the afformentioned error present in the varve counting methodology and the coarse resolution of the AMS radiocarbon date. 

The basal age for each core for was estimated using both the varve chronology and the AMS radiocarbon sedimentation rate. The basal age of V1 at a depth of 382 cm is 1622 BP based on the varve chronology and 2046 cal BP when extrapolating the AMS radiocarbon date. The basal age of V2 at a depth of 291 cm is 1913 BP based on the varve chronology and 2007 cal BP by extrapolating. The basal dates for these cores are only an approximation but given the relatively close agreement between the varve chronology and radiocarbon dates they are a reasonable estimate. 

*Sediment Yield Statistics* 

Higher sedimentation rates were observed proximal to the Cariboo River Delta in V1 compared to the more distal core V2, as observed in the Ekman surficial cores. Sedimentation rates estimated using varve chronology and AMS radiocarbon dates had a larger difference at V1 with 2.4 mm/yr and 1.87 +/- 0.04 mm/yr respectively. Closer agreement was observed at V2 with 1.52 mm/yr estimated by the varve chronology and 1.47 +/- 0.11 mm/yr from the AMS radiocarbon date. Some error is observed between the sedimentation rates estimated by the varve chronology and the AMS radiocarbon dates, particularly for V1, likely due to some of the afformentioned sources of error in the varve chronology and AMS radiocarbon methods. Still, the relatively close agreement between the two sedimentation rates gives confidence in further interpretations on the varve chronology at the multi-decade to century time scales. 

Figure \@ref(fig:varves) shows varve thickness measured from V1 and V2, which illustrates trends in suspended sediment delivery to Cariboo Lake at sub-decadal to centennial time scales. At V1, the 30-year average varve thickness remains above average from CE 0-600, 850-950, 1000-1100, 1150-1200 and below average between CE 800-850, 950-1000, 1100-1150, and 1200-1850. At V2, varve thickness is above average between CE 0-250, 350-450, 550-600, 1500-1600, 1700-1800, and 1900-1950 and below average between CE 250-350, 450-550, 1950-1500, 1450-1500, 1800-1900. Above average varve thickness is consistent between V1 and V2 between 0-500 CE, with a stronger signal observed for V1 which is closer to the main Cariboo River outlet. Below average varve thickness is observed at both V1 and V2 between 1000-1500 CE, with a stronger signal at V2. After this, trends in varve thickness between the two cores are not consistent, but generally remain below average for V1 and above average for V2. Sub-centennial trends are not reported due to the coarse temporal control for both V1 and V2.

*Grain Size*

Figure \@ref(fig:particle) shows that grain size for both V1 and V2 is above average between 0-500 CE and below average from 700-1500 CE. After 1500 CE grain size follows an increasing trend at V1 and at V2 grain size remains around average until 1950 CE where there is an increase. Overall, grain size fluctuations at a 100-year resolution show good correspondence between cores V1 and V2 over the past 2000 years.

The black X's on the bottom graph of V1 and V2 denote the AMS radiocarbon age (± dating error) and depth of the respective sample."}

*Loss on Ignition*

Figure \@ref(fig:loi) shows the percent mass lost on ignition (LOI) for both V1 and V2. Periods of above average LOI for V1 occur around CE 0-500, 650-1100, 1150, 1300, 1750-1850 and below average between 50 BCE - 50 CE, CE 550-650, 1150-1300, 1350-1750, 1850-2000. LOI is above between at V2 around CE 0-100, 250-500, 650-900, 1800-1950, and below average between 1000-1050, 1300-1600, 1950-2000.
