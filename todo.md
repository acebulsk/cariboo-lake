# TO DO
  - disc. fig caption
  - write discussion & conc.
  - write introduction 
  - get rid of black line in fig 2
  - fig captions from joe edits
  - EK -> E
  - add this fig ggsave('figs/longcore_cumulative_depth_vs_estimated_year_w_ams_and_varve.png', width = 6, height = 4.5)
  - should floods be removed from the stdep calc. currently they are
  - weighted mean??== rolling mean 
  - update turbidites table 
  - other well defined turbidite beds were observed throughout V1 and V2 but were too small to be analalyzed for grainsize or loi analysis ~ 2 mm and are as follows.... .csv
  - > v2.sd
[1] 1.36798
> v2.mean
[1] 1.567543

> v1.sd
[1] 1.08267
> v1.mean
[1] 2.427643

- maybe include 1952 varve layer 
- add fan delta locations to acoustics map
- full read through then discussion update

- fin joes may revisions
- glacier extent withing CB lake watershed boundary (specifically roberts peak glacier)
- no sub section fig numbering
- send joe vibro + ekman layer thickness plot
- add long core example of laminae (good) and graded turbidite, joe wants turbidite plot below these
- what is the watershed to lake ratio watershed/lake area for CL and QL
- I see D50 of Ekmans are 30 microns and less for most. What was the D90? Can you plot D90 and D10 above and below D50 in Figure 5? You have all that Malvern data but only give average.
- ask Joe confirm error calculation on grain size reporting (took average sdev for individual 3 * measurements)
