# TO DO
  - discussion figure
  - fig captions from joe edits
  - add this fig ggsave('figs/longcore_cumulative_depth_vs_estimated_year_w_ams_and_varve.png', width = 6, height = 4.5)

- maybe include 1952 varve layer 
- add fan delta locations to acoustics map
- full read through then discussion update

- send joe vibro + ekman layer thickness plot
- I see D50 of Ekmans are 30 microns and less for most. What was the D90? Can you plot D90 and D10 above and below D50 in Figure 5? You have all that Malvern data but only give average.
- ask Joe confirm error calculation on grain size reporting (took average sdev for individual 3 * measurements)
- as of jun 5 2022 have going through Joes edits on the Apr 10 2022 full writeup. just need to do some todos above
- core location map river delta -> fan delta
- rm varve label from bott panel on turbidite graphy stdeps
- Fig. or Figure ?
- loitoOM
- fig numbering
