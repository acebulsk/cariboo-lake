# TO DO
  - disc. fig caption
  - write discussion & conc.
  - write introduction 
  - get rid of black line in fig 2
  - fig captions from joe edits
  - EK -> E
  - add this fig ggsave('figs/longcore_cumulative_depth_vs_estimated_year_w_ams_and_varve.png', width = 6, height = 4.5)
  - should floods be removed from the stdep calc. currently they are
  - weighted mean??== rolling mean 
  - update turbidites table 
  - other well defined turbidite beds were observed throughout V1 and V2 but were too small to be analalyzed for grainsize or loi analysis ~ 2 mm and are as follows.... .csv
  - > v2.sd
[1] 1.36798
> v2.mean
[1] 1.567543

> v1.sd
[1] 1.08267
> v1.mean
[1] 2.427643

- maybe include 1952 varve layer 
- add fan delta locations to acoustics map
- full read through then discussion update

- fin joes may revisions
- glacier extent withing CB lake watershed boundary (specifically roberts peak glacier)
- add delta labels or rm from text
- no sub section fig numbering
- add ekman 13 and 11 to v2 v1 varve thickness, maybe just take sd and mean from the long core and copy over to ekman script ....
