# Introduction

Environmental proxies that extend back beyond the modern observable record are crucial to understanding earth system processes [@Turney2019; @Huber2012; @Nelson2016]. Proxy reconstructions at the sub-annual scale (e.g. ice cores, tree rings, and corals), to multi-decadal scales (e.g.sediments, pollen, boreholes) have proven useful in describing past environmental conditions across the globe [@Masson2013]. Sedimentary sequences collected from glaciated watersheds have been important in contributing to regional understanding of climate and hydrologic variability over the late Holocene. Research by @Neukom2019 have utilized sedimentary sequences as part of larger paleolimnological collections to provide a reconstruction of temperature variability over the last 2000 years. In western Canada, recovered sedimentary sequences have been collected in the Coastal Mountains [@Menounos2008], St.Elias Mountains [@Crookshanks2008], Monashee Mountains [@Hodder2006], and Rocky Mountains [@Desloges1999a]. A study by @Gilbert2012 looked at late glacial and Holocene infill of Quesnel Lake in east-central BC but this lake and watershed represented a much larger and less climate sensitive sedimentary system. To fill in a gap for higher resolution sedimentary records from the Carbioo Mountains the study here was undertaken at the smaller Cariboo Lake (11 km2).  

This study aims to presents a new record of Holocene hydroclimatic variability over the past 10 k years using lake bottom sediment records recovered by using sub-bottom acoustic methods (coarse resolution), and long sediments cores (fine resolution covering the last 2 k years). To determine if the Cariboo Lake contains a record of regional temperature and precipitation variability, the relative role of sediment input from the upstream Cariboo River, controlled by watershed wide trends in temperature and precipitation, compared to smaller unglaciated watersheds that border the lake is assessed. 

The purpose of this research is to 1) Establish an understanding of the mechanisms that control the production, connection, and transport of sediment into and within the Cariboo Lake basin. 2) determine whether sediment archives collected from Cariboo Lake contain a record of late Holocene glacier and sediment activity. 3) Compare the Cariboo Lake sediment record to other regional climate proxies. Previous studies have had success relating sediment archives with high resolution depositional sequences (e.g. varves) to changes in regional temperature, precipitation patterns, and glacier extent. However, these studies have primarily been located further east in the Rocky Mountains [@Desloges1999; Hodder2006]. 

# Study Area

Cariboo Lake is located in the northern foothills of the Columbia Mountains, 85 km northeast of Williams Lake, British Columbia Fig. \@ref(fig:map-basin). The lake receives runoff from an area of 3244 km^2^, and the watershed relief ranges from 2600 m asl in the headwaters to 600 m asl at the Cariboo Lake outlet. The area of Cariboo Lake including the Kiethley Creek sub-basin of 2 km^2^, is 10 km^2^ which results in a lake to watershed area ratio of 0.3%. The Cariboo Lake watershed has 64 km 2 of permanent ice cover which covers 2% of the total watershed [@Bolch2008]. The most extensive glaciated terrain is proximal to Mt. Lunn roughly 60 km upstream of Cariboo Lake.

The Cariboo River, located on the east end of the lake provides the main source of sediment into the lake. The lake is separated into two main basins, by the Keithley Creek fan delta (Fig. \@ref(fig:map-lake)). Here, the upstream basin is called the main Cariboo Lake basin, and the downstream basin is called the Keithley Creek basin. The bathymetry of the lake reaches a maximum depth of over 50 m in two scour holes within the central part of the main Cariboo Lake basin. These deep scour holes provide evidence of past glacial scouring.

Sediment connectivity to headwater glaciers along the Cariboo River is limited due to lake filtering by Lanezi and Sandy lake. Lanezi Lake is a deep fjord lake with a bathymetry reaching a maximum depth of 170 m. Sandy Lake is much shallower reaching a maximum depth of 6 m. The Matthews River, which meets the Cariboo River just below Lanezi Lake provides less filtered connection to meltwater from several alpine glaciers including the largest chunk of ice in the Cariboo Lake watershed, the Roberts Peak Glacier (10 km^2^).

# Methods

*Field Methods*

A field campaign was conducted during the summer of 2017 to collect sub-bottom acoustic soundings, dredge samples, and sediment cores. Thirty-four km of sub-bottom acoustic soundings were collected across Cariboo Lake using a 10 kHz StrataBox 3510 HD. An Ekman dredge was used to collect 20 ~10 cm^3^ samples of sediment from the lake bottom. The dredge samples were subsampled in the field using an 80 mm diameter PVC cylinder pushed into the block of sediment. The remaining sediment was kept as a bulk sediment sample. Four sediment cores (V1-V4) were collected using a Rossfelder submersible vibracorer with a 6 m long 70 mm diameter aluminum pipe. The Ekman subsample cores and the vibracores were split longitudinally with one half preserved as an archive and the other as a workging half. The working half samples were prepared for imaging by scraping the core parallel to the sediment laminae to create a flat surface which showed the sediment stratigraphy. The stratigraphy of cores V1 and V2 were best preserved and were selected for detailed analysis. 

*Laboratory Methods*

Cores V1 and V2 were subsampled with 2 cm^3^ of sediment extracted at a 5 cm interval, with additional samples taken within stratigraphic breaks. The Ekman bulk samples and vibracores were analyzed for laminae thickness, organic content, and particle size. Laminae couplets were digitally counted and measured for thickness using the ImageJ @imageJcite software. Organic content was determined by loss-on-ignition analysis (550 °C) following methods in @Smith2003. Samples were first weighed to provide an initial wet weight, then dried at 60 °C and weighed again after oven drying. The samples were then placed in a furnace at 550 °C for 2.5 hours and weighed a third time. Grain size analysis was conducted using a Mastersizer Particle Size Analyzer 3000. Samples were prepared following methods by @Gray2010 to remove the fine fraction of particles from organic material. This involved a removal of organic material using three sequential alloquots of 20% H202 until the sample stopped reacting. To prevent flocculation of sediment grains the samples were dispersed in 0.05% solution of Calgon for 24 hours. Grain size was measured three times for each sample, resulting in an average instrument error of +/- 0.01 µm. The chronology of both cores was provided by AMS ^14^C dating of wood fragments at the André E. Lalonde AMS Laboratory at the University of Ottawa and varve chronology from laminae counting on images.

# Discussion

Evidence of late Pleistocene deglaciation in the Cariboo Lake region is provided by coarse resolution sub-bottom acoustic results whereas greater detail of late Holocene watershed activity comes from sediment cores which span the last 2 ka BP. Evidence of late Pleistocene deglaciation and lake sediment infill of the nearby, and similar sized watershed of  Mud Lake (Fig. 1 – inset) is evaluated by by @Hodder2006. They found the early phases of deglaciation started just prior to 9.6 ka BP. Gilbert and Desloges (2012) indicate deglaciation of the north and west arms of the much larger Quesnel Lake was probably complete by 8.7 ka BP. @Menousnos2009 pointed to the deglaciation of most of the Cordilleran ice sheet before 10.5 ka BP. The Cariboo Lake acoustic results contribute to this regional record. Higher resolution AMS dated sediments from the west arm of Quesnel Lake (@Gilbert2012) showed a very consistent mean rate of sedimentation throughout the entire Holocene. Contrasting somewhat from this pattern are results from @Menounos2009 and @Desloges1999 who note that early to mid Holocene sediment accumulation rates in the southeastern Canadian Cordillera were lower than the late Holocene neoglacial period. However, those shifts came from watersheds with much higher percentages of glacier ice cover. So, we believe using the 2 ka rates from Cariboo Lake to estimate thickness of the Holocene sediment package is valid. 

Sub-bottom acoustic records from Transect B shown in Figure 4, which is proximal to the V1 core, indicate an upward transition from massive to well layered sediments occurring at a depth of about 20 m. Assuming a Holocene sediment accumulation rate of approximate 1.9 mm/yr from V1, this would put this transition at about 10.5 ka BP. Transect C, located in-between cores V1 and V2, has ~ 15 m of well layered sediment overlying a massively layered lower facies. Using a combined V1 and V2 average accumulation rate of 1.7 mm/yr in this region of the lake puts this facies transition at around 9 ka BP. The timing of this transition is similar to the onset of deglaciation and start of the Holocene sediment package within Mud Lake, BC in @Hodder2006 of 9.6 ka BP, Moose Lake, BC in @Desloges1999 around 10.3 ka BP, Gilbert and Desloges (2012) in Quesnel Lake at 8.7 ka BP and the Upper Bow River, AB in @Leonard1999 11.7 ka BP. The massively layered sediment package of Cariboo Lake that underlies/predates the 10.5 - 9 ka BP boundary is therefore likely a result of high energy sediment delivery when glacier ice was more proximal to the lake.  Warming in the early Holocene, around 9.10-6.70 ka BP in the Rockies (@Luckman1986) and British Columbia (@Clague1989) would lead to a more regular seasonality of sediment inputs and lamiae formation. This is coincident with a hypsithermal depletion of glacier ice in the upper cirque basins of the Cariboo watershed.

Although coarser grained sediments from discrete turbidite flows are found proximal to sidewall tributary deltas, silt and clay comprise over 90% of the sediment at V1 and V2 and is inferred to have been delivered via suspension from the main Cariboo River. Therefore, the sediment stratigraphy from cores V1 and V2 provide a high-resolution physical proxy for late Holocene hydroclimatic regimes in the watershed. The Cariboo River has two main tributaries, the Upper Cariboo River and the Matthew River which are connected to high alpine peaks and glaciers which provide a significant source of sediment. Sediment connectivity between these upper tributaries is limited by several deep fjord like lakes including Lanezi Lake and Sandy Lake along the Upper Cariboo River, and Ghost Lake along the Matthew River. They act as sediment traps limiting the transfer of sediment from the glacier sediment production zones and resultthe low sedimentation rates observed in cores V1 and V2. Although connectivity is limited, there are sufficient seasonal contrasts in suspended sediment flux to produce couplets (annual varves) in the main basin of Cariboo Lake. This is unlike the west arm of Quesnel Lake where sediment rates are 2 to 3 times lower due storage in the massive upper lake regions producing non-annual layering. This difference in sediment rates is expected due to the lower lake to watershed area ratio of 0.3% for Cariboo Lake compared to the much larger Quesnel Lake which has a ratio of 4.7%.

Across the Canadian Cordillera glacial lakes have a range of Holocene accumulation rates from relatively low at millimeters per year (e.g. Quesnel Lake with 0.7 mm/yr; @Gilbert2012), to centimeters per year (e.g., Lillooet Lake, 2-7 cm/a; @Gilbert2009), to a maximum of 0.5 m/a observered in Kluane Lake (@Gilbert2009). The relative range in accumulation rates has been understood to be a result in the variability of sediment production from glacier processes and steep topography [@Ballantyne2002], and the basin connectivity to deliver the sediment downvalley @cite. The average accumulation rate for Cariboo Lake of 1.7 mm/yr over the last two millenia, based off on an average of two radiocarbon dates, fits on the lower end of the range of accumulation rates previously identified across the Canadian Cordillera. While Quesnel Lake is adjacent to the Cariboo Lake Basin and located in a similar topographic setting, the relatively low glacier coverage of 0.8% for that basin combined with the extreme lake volume and length from source areas likely limits sediment deliver to the lake bed. Moose Lake, which is fed by the steep valley glaciers of Mount Robson, and has basin glacier coverage of 3.2%, has a average sediment accumulation of 2.7 mm/yr.

Previous authors on sediment varve studies have noted the sediment signal from climatic transitions typically occur over hundreds of years due to the slow reponse of sediment availability, conveyance, and deposition. Boundary conditions may also exist which can limit the sensitivity of sediment yield to climate change [@Desloges1999]

Higher organic content corresponds with higher rates of sediment accumulation from 0-700 CE. 

Comparison to regional climate anomalies 

- Thicker and coarser varves from 0-700 CE during colder wetter climate, why is there more LOI during this time.
- Smaller less coarse varves from 700-1500 CE during warmer dryer climate, LOI stays high.
- Coarser, thick varves during cold wet climate over the LIA, and LOI decreases
- Post- LIA LOI shows dramatic decline in organic content. Maybe lead lag effect? Boundry Conditions?
- One of the components of this study is the relative role of upstream sediment inputs controlled by watershed wide temp and precip trends and inputs of sediment from small watersheds that boarder the lake. The small lake deltas appears at first to be important at first but the study I think shows that they are good at delivering coarse sediment and not the fine stuff that makes up the “climate” sensitive varve sediments of the deep basin. These small, unglaciated basins do not provide a significant source of fine grained sediments. So one of the questions is are the turbidites (thicker more massive beds) resulting from major flooding off the main Cariboo delta or are they the result of local, small tributary inputs. initially suggest these are importunique features of this


# Conclusion

- Acoustic records provide coarse resolution of sedimentation into Cariboo Lake. Facies A and B from transect C, totaling 25 m thick provide evidence of sediment accumulation rates from 15 ka BP to present (based on 1.7 mm/yr avg accumulation rate from V1 and V2 AMS dates). Higher rates of sediment delivery to Cariboo Lake is evident over Facies A, from 15 - 9 ka BP. More frequent, but lower in magnitude reflectors are observed over Facies B, from 9 ka BP to present. 
- Rhythmically laminated silt and clay sediment are found in deep sub-basins (30-50 m deep) distal from river deltas.
- Above average sediment accumulation to Cariboo Lake is observed from 0 to 700 CE, above average from 700-1500 CE based on grain size and varve thickness, and average to above average from 1500 CE to present.
- Past major climate anomolies do not correlate well across all sediment characteristics
