SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATION:

The manuscript presents new sedimentary proxy data from Cariboo Lake, British Columbia, which the authors use to interpret Holocene glacier dynamics.  The interpretations regarding past environmental changes are justified and based on results from grain size, organic material, varve thickness, and radiocarbon dating analyses.  Similar studies from the western Canadian Cordillera are discussed to a reasonable degree of detail and provide a regional, long-term perspective in which to assess the new results.  The paper is well-organized and clearly written.  I recommend publication following a revision of the manuscript.


GENERAL COMMENTS:

While the radiocarbon and varve counting chronologies are well-explained it remains unclear how the ages of the top of cores V1 and V2 were determined.  In the Laboratory Methods subsection, it is stated that ‘’The top section of cores V1 and V2 were disturbed during coring which prevented counting and measurement of laminae couplets in 11 cm of V1 and 7 cm of V2. The absence of clear marker laminae and limited overlap between the long cores and short cores prevented anchoring of the long cores to the short cores.’’  Since this was the case, how was the age of the top of V1 and V2 determined/estimated?  In Figure 7, the top of V1 appears to be ca. 1985 CE and the top of V2 appears to be ca. 1975 CE, which is in line with the varying degree of disturbance.  Since the uppermost sediment was disturbed, was a constant sedimentation rate assumed to extrapolate the age of the top of the cores?  This is what appears to have been done based on the figure.  Even though a marker horizon could not be identified to stratigraphically tie the Ekman core (E13) to V1 and V2, wouldn’t the sedimentation rate measured from E13 provide a more valid estimate of the age of the uppermost undisturbed sediment in V1 and V2?  Also, can you discount that some sediment from the top of cores V1 and V2 was not lost during core recovery?  How much uncertainty does this issue add to the varve counting chronology?

I recommend that a common time scale (ka BP or CE) be adopted for the text and figures.  If having both scales is important then I would suggest adding a second legend to Figures 7 and 9-12, while remaining consistent with ka BP or CE in the manuscript text.

The interpretations of late Holocene glacier dynamics could be communicated more clearly if they were illustrated or noted on Figure 12.  I.e., it would allow readers to more easily identify the specific trends that are used to justify interpretations of past glacier extents.  For example, the trends could be annotated i, ii, iii, etc and explained in the caption.  Specific trends/inflections that should be noted include:
- above average varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter, 2.0-1.3 ka
- FMA increase in varve thickness and grain size
- coarsening trend of grain size from 750-1000 CE
- coarser varves and a reduction in organic matter, ca. 1750-1825 CE
- dramatic decline in organic matter and increase in grain size, ca. 1800-1900 CE
This would also help readers evaluate how the trends in this study compare with those cited in Figures 12D-F.


SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

INTRODUCTION

Line 105:
‘’… in the Coast and Rocky mountains.’’

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Lines 117-119:
‘’The absence of clear marker laminae and limited overlap between the long cores and short cores prevented anchoring of the long cores to the short cores.’’
Based on the subsequent results and discussion, and as illustrated in the inset to Figure 7, the ‘’top’’ of the long cores, such as they were (i.e. somewhat disturbed), were assigned an age.  Can you elaborate on this step?

RESULTS

Lines 211-212:
‘’On the south side of transect B, the thickness of acoustically well-stratified deposits ranges from 10 to 20 m.’’

Lines 213-214:
‘’Acoustic penetration of the sedimentary record increases 4.5 km from the Cariboo River delta along Transect C, where maximum sediment thicknesses of 35 m are observed (Figure 4, C).’’

Lines 215-216:
‘’… from the Last Glacial Maximum…’’ is perhaps unnecessarily specific.  Is it more likely that any sub-ice facies and/or proglacial glaciolacustrine facies was deposited during the last deglaciation of the valley?

Line 218:
Does the reference to ‘’Figure 4, C – A’’ refer to panels C and A in Figure 4 or to acoustic facies (A) on panel C?  I suggest that all the acoustic facies have a common numbering scheme (i.e. A, B, … or (i), (ii), …)) and that any acoustic reflectors that are discussed in the text (i.e. top of basement, scours) be designated R1, R2, etc.  Adding a simple legend to Figure 4 would also help readers better understand the acoustic stratigraphy.
What does ‘’undisturbed sections’’ mean?

Lines 219-220:
‘’Two sharp-crested v-shaped notches in the middle of Transect C are interpreted as unconformities (Figure 4).’’

Lines 220-222:
Possible to label the erosional unconformities on Figure 4B?
‘’The channels are the same as those in Transect B (Figure 4) and are interpreted to be scour channels formed by erosive, higher energy, turbidity currents that likely date to deglaciation of the lake basin.’’

Lines 226-228:
‘’Facies B has an average thickness of ~10 m and reaches a maximum thickness of 13 m where it infills two scour channels …’’

Lines 229-233
Facies A and B are not labelled on Figure 4D, which makes the figure a poor aid for understanding the text.  I suggest not reusing labels in Figures 4A-F, i.e., (i, iii).  Have a unique identifier for each feature, i.e. (i) multiple, (ii) scour channel, (iii) bedrock or coarse-grained deposit (diamict), (iv) slump, etc…

Line 243:
Typo ‘’the the’’

Lines 245-246:
Do you mean ‘’Proximal to the Cariboo River delta, surface sediments are dominantly massive, have numerous erosive contacts, and comprise more than 60% sand.’’?

Lines 246-247:
‘’A sand bed with a thickness of 1 cm was observed in E1, …’’

Lines 248-250:
‘’In the main Cariboo River basin, core E13, retrieved 5.24 km from the Cariboo River delta and from a depth of 40 m, contained fine, rhythmically laminated sediment (Figure 6B).’’

Lines 251-254:
‘’Sediment cores E9-E15 and E18-E20, retrieved from areas distal to the main Cariboo River delta, at lake depths of 30-50 m, have a high fraction of silt and clay and exhibit a rhythmic sequence of fine-grained dark layers overlain by coarse-grained light layers (Figure 6B and 6C).’’

Line 255:
‘’… are similar to annual laminations (varves), which occur in lakes …’’

Lines 261-264:
‘’Additional deposition of coarse-grained sediment may also result from abnormally high discharge events caused by large rainfall events, rain-on-snow events, rapid melt of glaciers and snowpack during heat waves, and/or turbidity currents due to delta collapse (Sabatier et al., 2022).’’

Line 267:
‘’… watershed suggests that deposition of multiple coarse-grained laminae in a single year is rare …’’

Lines 268-270:
‘’… Cariboo Lake due to turbidity currents from delta slumping/foreset failures, however turbidites were only observed in Ekman cores proximal to river deltas …’’

Line 276:
‘’… for tephra was made …’’

Lines 283-284:
‘’… yielded ages of 1743-1884 cal BP and 1874-2044 cal BP, respectively.’’
Move the Reimer (2020) reference to the caption for Table 1.

Lines 287-289:
‘’Ekman surficial core 13 (E13) is most proximal to the V2 long core (Figure 2) and comprises similar rhythmically laminated sediment.  If one couplet corresponds to one year of sedimentation, then the resulting sediment accumulation rate would be 1.98 ± 0.19 mm yr-1, which is consistent with those computed from the 14C chronologies of V1 and V2 (Figure 7).’’

Lines 291-293:
‘’Therefore, the couplets within the Ekman cores are interpreted as varves.  We note that higher accumulation rates …’’

Line 294:
‘’… of compaction as deeper sediment …’’

Lines 294-296:
The last sentence of this paragraph is somewhat repetitive and can be removed.

Lines 312-314:
‘’ Differences between the 14C and varve chronologies for each core were attributed to uncertainties with couplet counting and AMS 14C dating.’’
Does ‘’uncertainties with couplet counting’’ include the possibility that some couplets were removed by turbidity currents?

Line 321:
‘’… of this basin suggests …’’

Lines 321-323:
‘’This hypothesis is also supported by Figure 7 which shows a negative bias of the varve chronology compared to the calibrated 14C age-depth model.’’
Does this effectively mean that there are missing varves?  If so, could you surmise that the removal of couplets by turbidity currents a more important factor for the varve chronology than multiple high-discharge events per year?

Lines 325-326:
‘’… and/or thickness greater than 6 standard deviations for V1 and 2 standard deviations for V2 from the mean.’’
Why a different threshold for the two cores?

Line 327:
‘’… compared to a turbidite.’’

Lines 336-338:
‘’The increased grain size and greater thickness of the turbidites illustrate the high sediment flux during these events compared to the annual couplets (Table 2).’’

Line 340:
‘’… for the annual couplets is …’’

Lines 352-353:
‘’For core V1, couplets were counted down to a core depth of 343 cm, where the organic material for 14C dating was retrieved.’’

Lines 353-355:
‘’This resulted in a couplet-derived age of 1419 ± 142 yr BP compared to the two-sigma calibrated 14C age of 1820-1918 cal BP.’’

Lines 355-357:
‘’ For core V2, the couplets yielded an age of 1792 ± 180 yr BP for the organic material at 281 cm depth, which matches closely the 14C age of 1895-2043 cal BP.’’

Line 400:
‘’The average percent organic matter (OM) of cores V1 and V2 is similar …’’

DISCUSSION

Line 413-414:
‘’Rhythmically laminated silt and clay transported …’’

Lines 415-416:
‘’… from the Cariboo River were observed in the deep basins of the lake, which lie distal to river deltas where turbidity …’’
Unless there are two Cariboo Rivers I don’t think ‘’main’’ is necessary.

Lines 416-418:
‘’Thus, environmental changes in the glaciated catchment upstream of this delta control the delivery of sediment into Cariboo Lake.’’
This statement does not logically follow from the preceding text.  Perhaps you mean to say ‘’Thus, the sedimentary record of Cariboo Lake is a proxy archive for past environmental changes in the glaciated catchment.’’?  But this was already intimated in the first sentence of the Discussion.

Line 422:
‘’… from the Cariboo River …’’

Lines 451-454:
‘’Evidence for high deglacial sediment accumulation rates in Quesnel Lake, resulting from large, dynamic glaciers, suggests that similar basins such as Cariboo Lake also experienced high accumulation rates during deglaciation.’’

Lines 457-458:
‘’… indicate an upward transition from massive (Facies A) to well-stratified deposits (Facies B) at about 20 m below the lake floor (Figure 4).’’

Lines 460-462:
‘’Transect C, located in between cores V1 and V2, shows the transition of Facies A to B occurring at a depth of around 15 m (Figure 4).’’

Lines 478-480:
‘’Warming in the early Holocene around 9.10-6.70 ka BP in the Canadian Rockies specifically (Luckman, 1986), and in British Columbia more generally (Clague et al., 1989; Steinman et al., 2019), led to two possible sedimentation regimes.’’

Lines 480-484:
‘’The first is characterized by more regular seasonality of sediment inputs and laminae couplet formation due to the influence of glaciers that persisted in the Canadian Rockies through the warm interval (e.g. Mud Lake, Hodder et al., 2006).  The second is characterized by much lower sediment accumulation and seasonality resulting from the widespread disappearance of glaciers during the warm interval (e.g. Moose Lake, Desloges, 1999).’’

Lines 488-489:
‘’… who noted that early to mid-Holocene sediment accumulation rates in the southeastern Canadian Cordillera were lower than those in the late Holocene.’’

Lines 489-490:
Unclear what studies you are referencing here.  What studies do you mean by ‘’those’’?

Lines 492-494:
‘’The highest rates of >2 cm/yr are observed in ice-contact to ice-proximal lakes of various sizes (Crookshanks & Gilbert, 2008; Desloges & Gilbert, 1994), whereas the lowest rates are less than 1 mm yr-1 (Gilbert & Desloges, 2012).’’

Lines 494-498:
‘’The range in accumulation rates is understood to be a result of the variability of sediment production from glacial processes, the steepness of topography (Ballantyne, 2002), the persistence of ice cover, and the degree of basin connectivity, which can enhance or impede delivery of sediment down valley (Wohl et al., 2019).’’

Line 500:
‘’… during this period …’’
Here do you mean the late Holocene, entire Holocene?
What are optimal criteria?

Lines 504-506:
‘’… act as sediment traps, eliminating the downstream transfer of coarse sediment and some finer sediment from their source areas.’’

Lines 507-508:
‘’Still, there were sufficient seasonal variations in suspended sediment flux to Cariboo Lake over the last two millennia to produce the documented, high-resolution (varved) sedimentary archive.’’

Lines 515-516:
‘’… on the raw couplet thickness data (Figure 12A).’’

Lines 517-521:
‘’These trends are compared to a regional climate proxy re-analysis for the northern hemisphere (Moberg et al., 2005; Figure 12D), western Canada peak glacier extent estimates (Solomina et al., 2016; Figure 12E), and hydroclimate anomaly estimates for the northern hemisphere (Ljungqvist et al., 2016; Figure 12F).’’

Line 521:
‘Proxy reconstructions of past climate, glacier extent, and hydroclimate have century-scale resolution or lower.’’
Century- to millennial-scale?

Line 523:
‘’… from 2.0-1.3 ka BP …’’
In the Discussion the timing of various trends in the data series are cited using ka BP, whereas Figure 12 uses CE.  I suggest you be consistent here and use only CE or ka BP.

Lines 529-531:
‘’The increase in sediment production and sediment availability due to glacier expansion and retreat following the FMA may be reflected in the Cariboo Lake record by an increase in varve thickness and grain size (Figure 12).’’
Can you describe in more detail/quantify the trends in the varve thickness and grain size data that you are referring to here?

Line 542:
‘’ The coarsening trend in grain size data from …’’

Line 542:
‘’… from 750-1000 CE …’’
Again, I suggest you use a consistent timescale for the text and figures.

Lines 543-544:
‘’… glacier advance in the Canadian Rockies around 1250 CE (Leonard, 1997 …’’

Lines 547-548:
‘’… the highest temperature anomaly of the Northern Hemisphere, the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA; Moberg et al., 2005; Figure 12).’’
Here it also be beneficial to readers to define the duration of the MCA.

Line 551:
‘’… lakes in northern Washington, USA that also support hypothesis regarding above average precipitation …’’

Lines 556:
‘’… which was centred around 1850 CE …’’ or ‘’… which culminated around 1850 CE …’’

Lines 558-560:
‘’The change in varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter began earlier in V1 at around 1750 CE, compared to V2 which began to change around 1825 CE.’’

Line 560:
‘’The age discrepancy in data series trends between the two cores …’’

Lines 561-563:
Consider a clearer, more detailed description of the overall character of glacier expansion during the LIA.  Here you refer to the ‘’second advance of the LIA’’ and ‘’earlier phases of the LIA’’ but there is insufficient context in the Discussion for readers to parse these distinctions.

Lines 569-571:
‘’Following the LIA, around 1800 to 1900 CE, a dramatic decline in organic matter and an increase in grain size is observed in Cariboo Lake, which suggests a higher flux of clastic sediment to the basin.’’

Lines 571-572:
‘’This could be attributed to an increase in sediment availability as glaciers retreated more rapidly from LIA extents, exposing more clastic sediment (Beedle et al., 2015).’’


CONCLUSIONS

Line 581:
‘’… results in sediment input via the Cariboo Lake delta that is …’’

Lines 585-586:
‘’Sub-bottom acoustic records provide insight into the thickness and distribution of Holocene deposits.’’

Lines 586-587:
‘’… massive to acoustically-stratified sediment …’’

Lines 590-592:
‘’… is similar to other published study areas across British Columbia and Alberta.’’

Lines 593-596:
Somewhat unsure what you are trying to communicate here.  Here you use ‘’hypsithermal’’ for the first time in the manuscript - should this be defined for your readers?  Facies B includes the late Holocene sequence, which contradicts the last sentence here.  Do you mean Facies A?

Lines 597-600:
‘’Sediment in the long cores indicates that clastic delivery during the late Holocene to present has been dominated by silt (spring freshet) and clay (winter settling), resulting in the formation of rhythmically laminated couplets that are interpreted as varves.’’

Lines 605-606:
‘’However, additional data is required to confirm this.’’
Maybe so, but in your analysis you have treated the couplets as varves to develop a chronology and proxy record of past glacial activity.  Consider ‘’Additional chronological constraints may further refine our couplet counting chronology.’’

Lines 610-611:
These clear definitions of the FMA and LIA should be presented earlier in the Discussion and reiterated here.

Line 617:
‘’… and organic matter occurs …’’

Lines 624-625:
‘’… higher resolution Holocene record of sediment and glacier dynamics for interior British Columbia.’’


TABLES

Table 1
‘’ Table 1: Radiocarbon ages from Cariboo Lake sediment cores.’’
Add the lab number for each sample.
Remove the column ‘’Type’’.  The caption states that these are radiocarbon ages.

FIGURES

Figure 4

Add a legend and a simpler naming scheme for the facies and reflectors.  References in the text such as Figure 4, A (ii, iii) are somewhat confusing.  Consider: Figure 4a (Facies A, reflectors R2 and R3).  Do not reuse (i), (iii) for different features in multiple panels.

Figure 5

The subbasins could be designated on the x-axis of these plots, instead of using different sample shapes (circles, triangles, boxes).  This would simplify the legend (clay, silt, sand; D10, D50, D90).

Figure 7
The inset could be made larger to emphasize the chronology developed for E13.
The use of large triangles to denote the location of the turbidites is somewhat distracting, perhaps a short horizontal red line would suffice?  This is especially the case for the inset where the triangles obscure the uppermost parts of the V1 and V2 varve chronologies.
Is there a reason the dashed varve chronology is absent immediately below the first turbidite in core V1?  Were no apparent varves identified here?
The legend is awkwardly constructed.  Why are the turbidites classified as samples?  Further, the orange circles in the legend for E13 do not appear on the plot.

Comments to the authors
A mostly well written article that teases out some late Holocene glacier history from proxy data within two sediment cores collected from Caribou Lake, BC. There are numerous misspelt words and some sentence structure problems, some noted below. My main concern is the uncertainty around the time units chosen. Uncalibrated radiocarbon ages should be reported as e.g., 1450±45 yr BP.  Units for a calibrated radiocarbon age is for e.g., 1580 cal yr BP or 1.58 cal ka BP. For example, on line 52 (8.4 ka BP), I don’t know if this is calibrated (calendar years) or uncalibrated time as ka just means thousands of years. BP implies a 14C year, but ‘ka’ by itself is often used for non 14C dates, e.g., with OSL dating. All uncalibrated and calibrated ages should be rounded to the nearest 10 years in the tables and text. The discussion could be shortened.

Ranges in value, e.g., line 230 (5-10 m) should use an en dash rather than a hyphen (5–10 m).

Minor Items
Ln 17, data from paper just covers late Holocene time
Ln 27, insert ‘lake’ before filtering
Ln 46 ‘dyer’
Ln 81, 82, do lakes have current everywhere keeping sediment suspended? Would turbulence vs. current be a better was to explaining particle suspension?
Ln 132, 133, the ice predates the lake.
Ln 153, I suspect that fine OM and mud is also sourced from side tributaries, rather than just the Caribou R.
Ln 171, sediment does not compact while coring. Instead, there is sediment bypassing or rodding. See: Hoyt W.J. and Demarest J.M. II 1981. Vibracoring in Coastal Environments: A Description of Equipment and Procedures. SeaGrant College Program, University of Delaware, Newark, DEL-SG-01-81, pp. 20–31.

Volume 1: Basin Analysis, Coring, and Chronological Techniques, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, pp. 73–105.

Ln 256, the list of citations are all examples of varves, vs. original works defining varves. Winter layer is normally graded, and there is usually evidence of bioturbation in the summer couplet. See work by Jack Ridge, and Smith, N. D., and Ashley, G. M., 1985, Proglacial lacustrine environment, in Ashley, G. M., Shaw, J., and Smith, N. D., eds., Glacial Sedimentary Environments: Tulsa, OK, Society of Paleontologists and Mineralogists Short Course 16, p. 135–216.

Ln 275, topic sentence differs from 1st half of paragraph. Move volcanic ash discussion to end of paragraph.
Ln 321, which hypothesis? First mention of one in this paragraph. Many instances of starting sentences with ‘this’, and it is not always clear what is meant by ‘this’.
Ln 328, usually written as ‘normal grading’, which is grading that fines upwards.
Ln 360–63, awkward sentence.
Ln 363 ‘couples’
Ln 368, when counting varves to determine a chronology, how can the units ‘BP’ (i.e., 1950 A.D.) be used with varve year? Without an anchor to the surface or current year of coring, the varve count is a floating chronology, thus a minimum number of years.

Ln 387, label extent of LIA on Fig. 9.
Ln 396 ‘gain’
Ln 435, what does ‘this regional record’ refer to as the few previously mentioned ages for deglaciation vary by nearly 6000 years?
Ln 442–446, two sentences are unclear. Was not the entire area covered in ice, with deglaciation recorded by receding valley glaciers? Or do you mean once ice had retreated well upslope, they did not pause or readvance during the Younger Dryas, 8.2 ka event etc.?
Ln 468, insert ‘were’ in front of ‘reduced’.
Ln 474, you should say your ‘estimated’ timing of the transition . . .
Ln 484, for parallelism with first half of sentence, include type of sedimentary structure for the warm interval.
Ln 507, missing a word in the sentence, ‘form?
Ln 522, and throughout this paragraph, time units in text differ from those on the figure, making it confusing to the reader. Standardize.
Ln 351, duplicate words
Ln 594, first use of term ‘hypsithermal’ is in the conclusions, needs to be defined and introduced earlier.
Ln 620, ‘retried’
Ln 624, sentence structure

Table 1, Dell 13C of sample should be reported along with the lab code for both dates. 14C ages should be rounded to the nearest 10 years. Include units ‘yr’ after ‘cal’.

Ln 909 V1 and V2 are not purple and green on figure, they are black and blue.
Ln 922, the blue dashed lines are black on the figure.
Ln 926, add a sentence to explain anomaly, if positive number is that wetter?

Fig. 2, acoustic survey track line is very faint.
Fig. 3, add name of river for the runoff. Add horizontal axis label for months.
Fig. 5, move panel labels (A–D) to upper left of each panel. Hydrology names in legend should be capitalized.
Figs 10, 11 are repeated again in Fig. 12.
