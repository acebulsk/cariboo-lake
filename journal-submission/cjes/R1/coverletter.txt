This original research was undertaken over the last 5 years and represents our final results. This is our first submission to the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. We first submitted to the journal Holocene which went through two rounds of minor revisions by Byron Steinman and one anonymous reviewer. However, the paper was not accepted on the basis of third, new anonymous reviewer.

We have made substantial effort to incorporate all the suggestions of the two anonymous CJES reviews and the previous three reviews from the Holocene Journal in this new submission. We believe it is an ideal paper for the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences as the sediment archival record presents novel and new results for a lake system that is sensitive to Holocene climate fluctuations and one that is situated in a semi-arid area of the Canadian Cordillera. The laminated (varve) record provides significant evidence of sediment delivery and climate controls over the last 2 ka that match regional to global patterns suggesting that this Canadian lake/watershed type is ideal for Holocene environmental reconstruction and would be of interest to a national and international audience.
