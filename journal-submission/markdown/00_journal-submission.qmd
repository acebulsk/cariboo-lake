**Abstract:** Records of sedimentation collected from Cariboo Lake, situated in the northern Columbia Mountains, British Columbia, Canada, are analyzed to assess Holocene fluvial and glacial watershed dynamics. The aim of this study is to provide a proxy record of Holocene hydroclimate and glacier change from sediment archives at a higher temporal resolution compared to available records for the Interior Ranges of British Columbia. Deglacial and Holocene sediment accumulation is observed to reach a maximum thickness of 35 m in deep parts of the lake, using sub-bottom acoustic soundings. A transition from massive to well-layered sediments is observed in the sub-bottom acoustic record during final phases of valley deglaciation in the region (ca. 10.5-9 ka BP). Laminae couplets are interpreted to be deposited annually according to two ^14^C dates and a varve counting chronology. Two long cores, 2.9 and 3.8 m in length, were selected for analysis with estimated basal dates of 2 ka BP. Trends in downcore sediment characteristics were linked to environmental changes in the glaciated catchment headwaters at a temporal resolution of ~100 yrs. Upstream filtering of river floodplains and lakes prevented finding a higher temporal resolution linkage between the sediment characteristics and headwater fluvial and glacial activity. Despite some upstream filtering, the Cariboo River was found to be the primary source of sediment to the long core sites. Observed grain size and varve thickness from two long cores show above average trends which are coincident with cooler temperatures and the primary glacier advances over the last 2 ka.

# Introduction

Climatic variability in the western Canadian Cordillera over the Holocene contributed to several fluctuations in glacial activity with implications for sediment accumulation in glacier-fed lakes. There is general regional agreement between the Coast Mountains [@Ryder1986; @Brown2006; @Menounos2004; @Koch2007a; @Osborn2007; @Menounos2008c] and Canadian Rocky Mountains [@Luckman1988; @Luckman1993; @Luckman1993a; @Leonard1997; @Hodder2006b] on the timing and magnitude of the large early Holocene retreat and late Holocene LIA advance. However, the smaller fluctuations that occurred between these large events have less regional agreement [@Menounos2009b]. Furthermore, few proxy records exist in central British Columbia, that provide a high-resolution record of Holocene hydroclimatic variability [@Gilbert2012; @Hodder2006b; @Menounos2009b; @Maurer2012b]. Central British Columbia is characterized by a transitional climate between the wetter Coastal Mountain Ranges to the dyer Rocky Mountain Ranges, which may contribute to a different response of glaciers for this region over the Holocene.

A study by @Gilbert2012 of Quesnel Lake (272 km^2^), 30 km south of the study area examined here, found high rates of sediment accumulation around 10.4 ka BP during early Holocene deglaciation, and around 8.4 ka BP sediment accumulation declined significantly. Meaningful trends in organic matter and grain size of Quesnel Lake sediment sequences at a sub-millennial time scale were not detectable. Quesnel Lake is very large relative to the contributing watershed and therefore the sediment system exhibits very low accumulation rates and is much less sensitive to climate variability. Within the Cariboo Lake basin, @Maurer2012b investigated the headwater On-off Lake which remained intermittently connected to the Castle Creek Glacier on the basin divide (@fig-map-basin). Currently the Castle Creek Glacier resides outside of the Cariboo Lake basin, however, @Maurer2012b show that the glacier advanced north across the hydrological divide and into the Cariboo Lake basin several times over the Holocene. Both @Gilbert2012 and @Maurer2012b provide a long-term but coarse temporal resolution record of Holocene hydroclimatic variability in the Cariboo Mountains. Additional high-resolution proxy records of Holocene fluvial and glacial activity are needed for this transitional climate of central British Columbia; especially for the mid to late Holocene interval where greater regional variability in glacial responses to climate change has been observed [@Menounos2009b].

Environmental proxy records that extend back beyond the modern observable record are crucial to understanding earth system processes [@Turney2019; @Huber2012; @Nelson2016]. Proxy reconstructions at the sub-annual (e.g. ice cores, tree rings, corals, varved-sediments), to multi-decadal scales (e.g. sediments, pollen, boreholes) have proven useful in describing past environmental conditions across the globe [@Masson2013]. In the case of sedimentary sequences collected from climate sensitive glaciated watersheds, they have been important in contributing to the regional understanding of climate and hydrologic variability over the Holocene. For example, researchers have utilized sedimentary sequences along with other environmental archives to provide regional [@Menounos2009b] and global [@Neukom2019] reconstructions of glacier and hydroclimatic change over the Holocene. The sensitivity and temporal resolution of lake sediment characteristics (e.g. varves thickness, grain size and organic content) and their connection to regional hydrology, temperature, precipitation patterns, and glacier extent varies amongst glacier-fed lake studies [@Desloges1999; @Hodder2006b; @Leonard1997; @Menounos2006b; @Menounos2008c]. Mountain basins that exhibit a strong nival-hydrographic regime typically produce distinct varve couplets with a fine-grained layer deposited in winter when the lake ices over and flow velocity decreases followed by a coarse-grained layer deposited during spring high flows [e.g. @Leonard1997; @Hodder2007c; @Desloges1999]. In contrast, lakes proximal to the Coast Mountains of British Columbia typically show greater variability in varve thickness due to the influence of frequent and large fall rain-storms that produce multiple coarse laminations within a single season [e.g. @Gilbert1997; @Menounos2008c]. Establishing a correlation between seasonal or annual trends in varve thickness, grain size, and organic content from sediment cores to local discharge, temperature, and precipitation is not always possible for short time scales due to complex process interactions, watershed connectivity and dating uncertainties [@Hodder2007c; @Menounos2008c; @Heideman2017]. The linkage between hydrology and climate drivers and the lake sediment record may be limited at short time scales (i.e. less than 10 years) if there is a weak connectivity between sediment production and delivery to the lake [@Hodder2007c; @Menounos2008c; @Heideman2017]. Trends in lake sediment sequences are typically more representative of climate fluctuations at longer time scales greater than 100 years as this provides sufficient time for changes in sediment production and delivery to propagate through the watershed [@Leonard1999; @Osborn2007; @Heideman2017]. Shorter timescale trends in climate change may still be reflected in lake sediment records but with less fidelity and confidence in the chronology.

The purpose of this research is to 1) establish an understanding of the mechanisms that control the delivery and deposition of the fine sediment fraction to Cariboo Lake, 2) to reconstruct the highest resolution and longest possible sediment accumulation record from cores and acoustic methods for this semi arid region of British Columbia, 3) determine if the sediment accumulation record contains a signal from fluvial and glacial activity driven by regional to continental hydroclimate change, and 4) ascertain how this record of hydroclimatic variability differs from other records collected in the Coastal and Rocky Mountains.

# Materials and methods

## Study Area

Cariboo Lake is located in the northern foothills of the Columbia Mountains, 85 km northeast of Williams Lake, British Columbia (@fig-map-basin). The lake is separated into two basins by a large alluvial fan building cross-valley from Keithley Creek (@fig-map-lake). The main Cariboo Lake basin, to the northeast of Keithley Creek, receives discharge from an area of 2636 km^2^, which is filtered by three upper watershed lakes: Issac Lake, Lanezi Lake, and Ghost Lake (@fig-map-basin). While these lakes are more proximal to glacial activity, and may contain sediment archives that are more closely linked to headwater changes in fluvial and glacial activity, higher sediment accumulation rates expected for these lakes, and their remote location, would have made it very difficult to retrieve a long-term sediment record. With this upstream filtering, Cariboo Lake has a lower sediment accumulation rate which presented a more accessible option to retrieve a sediment record that spans a longer time interval. 

The watershed relief ranges from 2600 m in the eastern Cariboo Mountain headwaters to 600 m at the western Cariboo Lake outlet. The lake area to watershed area ratio of the main Cariboo Lake basin is 0.3%. The southwest to northeast, 75 km long watershed spans a precipitation gradient ranging from 1370 mm yr^-1^ in the headwaters to 477 mm yr^-1^ at the semi-arid outlet to the lake. The Cariboo Lake watershed has 75 km^2^ of permanent ice cover which covers 3% of the total watershed [@Bolch2008]. The most extensive glaciated terrain is proximal to Mt. Lunn roughly 60 km upstream of Cariboo Lake (@fig-map-basin). The Cariboo Lake basin hydrology is inferred from the Water Survey of Canada station 08KH003 [@Albers2017] 20 km downvalley from the Cariboo Lake outlet (@fig-map-basin). The watershed is snow- and glacier-melt dominated with average 1971-2000 monthly runoff peaking in June (220 mm) and low-flows that occur between December and March (15-25 mm) (@fig-cl-hydro, A). From December to March air temperature is mostly below 0 °C and precipitation falls primarily as snow (@fig-cl-hydro). The bathymetry of the lake reaches a maximum depth of just over 50 m in two deep holes within the central part of the main Lake basin (@fig-map-lake). These deep holes provide some evidence of pre Holocene glacial scouring and ice extents that reached the lake.



Upper watershed Lanezi Lake and Sandy Lake contrast significantly in maximum depths at 170 m and 6 m, respectively (@fig-map-basin). The Matthews River, which meets the Cariboo River below Lanezi Lake, is filtered by Ghost Lake and provides an important connection to meltwater sources draining several alpine glaciers including the largest area of ice (10 km^2^) in the Cariboo Lake watershed, proximal to Roberts Peak (@fig-map-basin).

## Field Methods

A field campaign was conducted during the summer of 2017 to collect sub-bottom acoustic soundings, dredge samples, and sediment cores. Thirty-four kilometres of sub-bottom acoustic soundings were collected across Cariboo Lake using a 10 kHz StrataBox 3510 HD (@fig-map-lake). An Ekman dredge was used to collect 20 samples from the lake bottom, following a longitudinal transect down Cariboo Lake, each yielding ~730 cm^3^ of surficial sediment (@fig-map-lake). The dredge samples were sub-sampled in the field using an 8 cm diameter PVC cylinder. This resulted in 20 short cores each containing about 450 cm^3^ of sediment. Sub-sampling the dredge samples allowed for better preservation of the sediment stratigraphy compared to short cores taken directly in the lake. The Ekman dredge cores ranged from 6 to 12 cm in length. The sediment not captured in the PVC cylinder was kept as a bulk sediment sample. 

Four long sediment cores (V1-V4) were collected using a Rossfelder submersible vibracorer with a 6 m long, 6 cm diameter, aluminum pipe (@fig-map-lake). Sediment cores V1-V4 were retrieved at deep mid-lake locations to ensure the cores consisted of a higher fraction of fine clastic sediments. The transport of coarser grained sediments from non-glaciated tributaries feeding directly into Cariboo Lake during high flow events or steep valley sidewalls were expected to be limited to areas proximal to the perimeter of the lake. Cores V1 and V2 in the main Cariboo River basin were selected for detailed analysis as these two cores had the highest fraction of fine clastic sediments, their sediment stratigraphy was well preserved, and they both had organic material for^14^C dating. Cores V3 and V4 taken closer to the Frank Creek and Keithley Creek deltas also had higher fractions of coarse grained sediments and core disturbance and were not analyzed in detail.

## Laboratory Methods

Long and short cores were split longitudinally with one half preserved as an archive and the other as a working half. The working half samples were prepared for imaging by scraping the core parallel to the sediment laminae to create a flat surface which showed the sediment stratigraphy. The short and long sediment cores were analyzed for laminae thickness, organic content, and particle size. The working halves of long cores V1 and V2 were subsampled with 2 cm^3^ of sediment extracted at a 5 cm interval, with additional samples taken within stratigraphic facies that had visual changes in grain size and lamination patterns. Laminae couplets observed on the working halves were digitally counted and measured for thickness using the ImageJ software [@Schneider2012]. Uncertainty in laminae counting is attributed to sections of core with indiscernible laminae formation, core compaction, undercounting, and subjectivity in classifying the occasionally thicker (4 to 47 mm thick) graded to massive laminae/beds. The uncertainty of the laminae counting in this study was inferred from Ekman short cores (E12, E13, E14) which had statistically similar sediment accumulation rates. The varve counting error was estimated by counting the number of couplets down to a depth of 5 cm in each Ekman core. The top section of cores V1 and V2 were disturbed during coring which prevented counting and measurement of laminae couplets in 11 cm of V1 and 7 cm of V2. The absence of clear marker laminae and limited overlap between the long cores and short cores prevented anchoring of the long cores to the short cores. 

Organic matter was approximated from percent weight loss-on-ignition analysis (550 °C) [@Dean1974; @Smith2003]. Grain size analysis was conducted using a Mastersizer Particle Size Analyzer 3000. Samples were prepared following methods by @Gray2010 to remove organic material. Three sequential aliquots of 20% H~2~0~2~ were added until the sample stopped reacting. To prevent flocculation of sediment grains the samples were dispersed in 0.05% solution of sodium hexametaphosphate for 24 hours. Grain size was measured three times for each sample, resulting in an average standard deviation of ± 0.01 µm. 

The chronology of both long cores was reconstructed from Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) ^14^C ages of organic material (twigs and a conifer needle) found within the cores, and a chronology derived from laminae couplet counting on working core images. The ^14^C calibration was performed using Bchron, a Bayesian statistical age-model software package for R [@Parnell2008; @Parnell2011; @Haslett2008] and the IntCal20 calibration curve [@Reimer2020]. All data analysis and figure production were produced using the R language [@R2022].

# Discussion

Cariboo Lake was selected to test the utility of sediment archives from moderate sized glacier-fed lakes as a proxy of catchment-wide fluvial and glacial activity. The results from acoustic soundings and short-core sediment characteristics supports the hypothesis that sediment delivered from the Cariboo River is the primary source of sediment to Cariboo Lake. Rhythmically laminated silt and clay sediments transported primarily through suspended sediment processes from the main Cariboo River were observed in deep parts of the lake distal from river deltas, where turbidity currents and bedload transport processes are reduced. Thus, environmental changes in the glaciated catchment upstream of this delta control the delivery of sediment into Cariboo Lake. Although coarser grained sediments from discrete turbidite flows were observed proximal to sidewall tributary deltas (@fig-ekmanSeds), they are only transferred to deep lake deposits during rare episodic events (@tbl-turbTbl). The long core (V1 and V2) sediment is composed of nearly 99% silt and clay resulting in laminae couplets that are inferred to have been delivered via suspended sediment from the main Cariboo River. After removal of instantaneous turbidites, the long core sediment records are thought to be most representative of trends in Cariboo River discharge influenced by temperature and precipitation rather than isolated events and inputs from nearby tributaries and hillslopes. 

Evidence of late Pleistocene deglaciation in the Cariboo Lake region is provided by sub-bottom acoustic results. A maximum deglacial sediment thickness of ~35 m puts Cariboo Lake in the middle to lower range of Holocene sediment inputs in Canadian Cordilleran lakes [@Gilbert2012]. The study of smaller Mud Lake, in the Rocky Mountains to the east of Cariboo Lake (@fig-map-basin, inset) was evaluated by @Hodder2006b, who found the early phases of deglaciation and lake sediment infill started just prior to 9.6 ka BP. @Gilbert2012 indicate deglaciation of the north and west arms of nearby Quesnel Lake was likely complete by 8.6 ka BP. @Menounos2017 describe substantial loss of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet across western Canada as early as 14.0 ka BP. The Cariboo Lake acoustic results contribute to this regional record however the inferred bottom dates present uncertainty in the actual timing. 

Unlike many other deglacial sediment packages in Canadian Cordilleran lakes, the sediment infill in Cariboo Lake has been subject to deep trenching during deglaciation and the early Holocene (@fig-acoustics, C). The troughs, with sediment infills occurring at different times, suggest the presence of highly erosive but intermittent bottom currents during deglaciation and possibly into the earliest Holocene. Energetic flow of cold sediment-rich meltwater flow would be required, suggesting proximity of an actively retreating valley glacier. The absence of lower elevations moraines in the valley upstream of Cariboo Lake might indicate rapidly retreating ice into headwater locations. However, in general, moraines indicative of stagnant ice fronts in lower elevation settings are not common elsewhere throughout much of the eastern Cordillera, suggesting that valley glacier development was limited [@Menounos2017].

In contemporary ice-proximal lakes with extensive coverage of active glaciers, high accumulation rates have been observed to be between 0.5 m yr^-1^ [@Crookshanks2008] and as high as 1 m yr^-1^ [@Gilbert1997] during deglaciation. Similar high accumulation rates in the late-glacial are inferred to have occurred in Quesnel Lake [@Gilbert2012], resulting in a thick pre-Holocene sediment package. This evidence for high pre/early Holocene accumulation rates in Quesnel Lake from large dynamic glaciers suggests that high accumulation rates are also likely for Cariboo Lake during this time and is supported by the acoustic data presented here.

Two transects of sub-bottom acoustic records analyzed within Cariboo Lake provide evidence of high sediment accumulation rates during the early Holocene. Sub-bottom acoustic records from Transect B, which is proximal to the V1 core, indicate an upward transition from massive-unlayered (Facies A) to well-layered sediments (Facies B) at a depth of about 20 m (@fig-acoustics). Assuming a maximum Holocene sediment accumulation rate of approximately 1.9 mm yr^-1^ from V1, this would put this transition at about 10.5 ka BP. Transect C, is located in between cores V1 and V2, shows the transition of Facies A to B occurring at a depth of around 15 m (@fig-acoustics). Using a combined V1 and V2 average Holocene sediment accumulation rate of 1.7 mm yr^-1^ in this region of the lake, puts the transition from Facies A to B at around 9 ka BP for Transect C, slightly later than the Transect B estimate. The massive structure of Facies A is inferred to be due to high rates of sediment delivery as glaciers retreated upvalley during the early Holocene after the formation of the deep trenches. The well-layered sediment of Facies B, along with the continuation of laminae couplets observed in cores V1 and V2 over the last 2 ka, suggests that glaciers reduced in extent at the start of the Holocene but did not disappear completely.

During the early Holocene sediment accumulation rates are generally lower across western Canada due to reduced glacier extent and warm temperatures [@Menounos2004; @Koch2007a; @Osborn2007; @Luckman1988; @Luckman1993]. Therefore, the estimated basal ages of Facies A and B may be much older if the actual accumulation rates were lower at that time. The timing of the transition between these two facies is similar to the onset of deglaciation and start of the Holocene sediment package within Mud Lake, BC [@Hodder2006b] around 9.6 ka BP, at Moose Lake, BC [@Desloges1999] around 10.3 ka BP, at Quesnel Lake, BC [@Gilbert2012] around 8.6 ka BP, and at the Upper Bow River, AB [@Leonard1999] around 11.7 ka BP. Warming in the early Holocene, around 9.10-6.70 ka BP in the Canadian Rockies, specifically, [@Luckman1986] and British Columbia, generally, [@Clague1989; @Steinman2019] led to two possible sedimentation regimes. Where glaciers persist in the Canadian Rockies through the warm interval resulting in more regular seasonality of sediment inputs and laminae couplet formation [e.g. Mud Lake, @Hodder2006b] and where glaciers disappear during the warm interval, leading to much lower accumulation and seasonality [e.g. Moose Lake, @Desloges1999]. Sub-bottom acoustic records from Cariboo Lake show continuous sediment accumulation rates throughout the Holocene. @Gilbert2012 also observed a consistent mean rate of sedimentation throughout the entire Holocene in the west arm of Quesnel Lake (@fig-map-basin). This contrasts somewhat from @Menounos2004 and @Desloges1999 who note that early to mid-Holocene sediment accumulation rates in the southeastern Canadian Cordillera were lower than the late Holocene. However, those shifts come from watersheds with much higher percentages of glacier ice cover (~15-40%). 

There is a documented range of late Holocene clastic sediment accumulation rates in glacier-fed lakes from across the Canadian Cordillera. Highest rates of > 2 cm/yr are observed in ice-contact to ice-proximal lakes of various sizes [@Desloges1994; @Crookshanks2008], to relatively low rates of < 1 mm yr^-1^ [@Gilbert2012]. The range in accumulation rates has been understood to be a result in the variability of sediment production from glacier processes, the steepness of topography [@Ballantyne2002], the persistence of ice cover and the degree of basin connectivity enhancing or impeding delivery of sediment down valley [@Wohl2019]. 

In the Cariboo Lake basin, the combination of upper watershed area, intervening storage, glacier cover and lake size are considered optimal during this period for the relatively consistent formation of clastic varves. The Cariboo River has two main tributaries, the Upper Cariboo River and the Matthew River which are connected to alpine peaks and glaciers providing a significant source of sediment (see Figure 2). Issac Lake, Lanezi Lake, and Ghost lakes act as sediment traps eliminating the transfer of coarse sediment and some limitation in the transfer of finer sediment from the glacier sediment production zones. This results in sediment accumulation rates that are on the low-end for the southeastern Cordillera [@Hodder2006b]. Still, there are sufficient seasonal contrasts in suspended sediment flux to annual varves in the main basin of Cariboo Lake over the last two millennia.

Lake sediment chronologies typically vary in their sensitivity to regional fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, from annual resolution in lakes with higher accumulation rates [e.g. @Menounos2008c] to centennial-scale in lakes with low accumulation rates [e.g. @Desloges1999]. Panel A in @fig-proxy-comparison shows the varve thickness chronology reconstructed as standardized departures from cores V1 and V2. There is a significant amount of noise in the record, typical of a filtered sediment transport system [e.g. @Jerolmack2010], so a lower resolution 30-year moving average is superimposed on the raw couplet thickness data in (@fig-proxy-comparison, A). Panel A and C in @fig-proxy-comparison show the lower-resolution temporal patterns in D~50~ grain size and organic matter content, respectively. These trends are compared against the @Moberg2005 regional climate proxy re-analysis for the northern hemisphere (@fig-proxy-comparison, D), @Solomina2016 western Canada peak glacier extent estimates (@fig-proxy-comparison, E), and @Ljungqvist2016 hydroclimate anomaly estimates for the northern hemisphere (@fig-proxy-comparison, F). Most of these are at resolutions of centennial scale or lower. 

For Cariboo Lake, above average varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter are observed for both V1 and V2 from 2.0-1.3 ka BP. In the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia [@Koch2007a; @Osborn2007; @Allen2007; @Clague2010] and in the Interior ranges and Rocky Mountains [@Luckman1993; @Luckman1995] glaciers were generally more extensive prior to 2.0 ka BP than present day. More recently than 2.0 ka BP, evidence of glacier expansion during the First Millennium Advance (FMA) has been found in some parts of the Coast Mountains [@Reyes2006; @Osborn2007] and Interior Ranges [@Maurer2012b]. The increase in sediment production and sediment availability due to extensive glacier advance and then retreat following the FMA may be reflected in the Cariboo Lake record by an increase increase in varve thickness and grain size  (@fig-proxy-comparison). Observations of an increase in clastic sedimentation rates in the Rocky Mountains were also observed around 1.8 ka BP in Hector Lake [@Leonard1997]. @Maurer2012b show that the Castle Creek Glacier intermittently advanced into On-off Lake and over the Cariboo River watershed divide throughout the late-Holocene between 2.73-2.35, 1.87-1.72, and 1.53-1.42 ka BP (@fig-proxy-comparison). Additional contributions of sediment from the Castle Creek Glacier would help contribute to above average varve thickness and grain size observed in Cariboo Lake from 2.0-1.3 ka BP. Above average organic matter observed in @fig-proxy-comparison is atypical during an increase of clastic sediment delivery but could be explained by some contributions from increased soil erosion below treeline during a time of higher precipitation rates and subsequent high spring freshet flows.

The coarsening trend of grain size from 750-1000 CE in Cariboo Lake is consistent with evidence of an early Little Ice Age (LIA) glacier advance centring around 1250 CE in the Canadian Rockies [@Luckman1995; @Osborn2001; @Leonard1997], in the Cariboo Lake basin around 1040-1160 CE [@Maurer2012b], and more broadly across western Canada around 1100 CE [@Solomina2016] (@fig-proxy-comparison, D). This interval of increased glacier activity also corresponds with the highest temperature anomaly of the Northern Hemisphere MCA [@Moberg2005] (@fig-proxy-comparison). However, @Ljungqvist2016 estimate precipitation to be above average around this time which could have contributed to an increase in glacier extent if corresponding temperatures were low enough. @Steinman2012 studied two lakes in northern Washington, USA which also support above average precipitation for this region during the MCA. Although temperatures are reported as slightly above average during the MCA [@Moberg2005] for the Northern Hemisphere, the increase in glacier activity during this time may have been a result of increased winter precipitation which may have lowered the ELA of glaciers in the Cariboo Lake basin.

The second glacier advance of the LIA, which centres around 1850 CE in the Canadian Rockies [@Luckman2000g; @Leonard1997] coincides with thicker and coarser varves, and a reduction in organic matter in Cariboo Lake (@fig-proxy-comparison). The change in varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter begins earlier for V1 at around 1750 CE compared to V2 which begins to change around 1825 CE. The discrepancy in the sediment characteristic trends between the two cores is considered small given the uncertainty in couplet counting. Overall, the response of varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter to the second advance of the LIA around 1850 CE exhibits a stronger response compared to earlier phases of the LIA. Temperature anomalies for the Northern Hemisphere reported by @Moberg2005, are also most negative from 1500-1750 CE. @Solomina2016 show glaciers reached maximum relative extents around this time. The @Moberg2005 and @Solomina2016 records suggest there was a strong influence of the LIA climate on glacier activity compared to the rest of the 2 ka record which is also reflected in the Cariboo Lake record (@fig-proxy-comparison). 

Following the LIA, around 1800 to 1900 CE a dramatic decline in organic matter and increase in grain size is observed in Cariboo Lake suggestive of high magnitude clastic sediment delivery. This could be attributed to the increase of sediment availability as glaciers retreated more rapidly from LIA extents and exposed stores of clastic sediments [@Beedle2015]. As glaciers declined from peak LIA extents around 1850 CE [@Leonard1997; @Luckman2000g], an increase in soil development, vegetation growth and subsequent bank stability is expected which may also contribute to a decline in OM as organic content is stored as needleleaf coniferous forest.

# Conclusions

The moderate-sized Cariboo Lake provides a record of deglacial and Holocene sediment inputs for central British Columbia. The steep climatic gradient from the wetter, glacier covered, headwaters of the Cariboo Mountains to the semi-arid, lower elevation zones of Cariboo Lake, result in sediment input via the main Cariboo Lake delta that is predominately derived from the glacier production zone. This conclusion is supported by the down-lake trends in varve thickness and grain size. The temporal sediment records presented here show trends in sediment accumulation and grain size which correspond to Holocene fluvial and glacial activity.

  1. Sub-bottom acoustic records provide a coarse temporal resolution chronology of early and mid-Holocene sediment accumulation. The transition from massive to acoustically well-layered sediment is estimated to have occurred around 10.5 to 9 ka BP. There is uncertainty with the timing of this transition as sediment accumulation rates have been extrapolated from the 2 ka old sediment cores. If correct, the 10.5 to 9 ka BP transition is similar to other glacier, lake and climate records across British Columbia and Alberta suggesting fairly consistent and rapid withdrawal of valley-bottom glacier ice into higher elevation zones.
  2. If trends observed in other southern Canadian Cordilleran lakes prevail, the early and mid-Holocene input of sediment during the hypsithermal would have been significantly reduced resulting in a Holocene sediment package within the 10-15 m range. Facies B most likely represents the mid-Holocene hypsithermal unit.
  3. Sedimentary structures in the long cores indicated sediment delivery, over the late Holocene to present, is dominated by similar fractions of silt (spring freshet) and clay (winter settling) resulting in the formation of rhythmically laminated couplets that are mainly varves. The fraction of fine clastic sediments observed in the Cariboo Lake cores is high compared to other lakes in the Canadian Cordillera which typically have a larger fraction of coarse sediment from more frequent fall or spring high flows. 
  4. The seasonal hydrology of the Cariboo Lake basin, high fraction of fine grained clastic sediment in cores V1 and V2, and the good agreement between the laminae counting and ^14^C chronology for core V2 suggests the couplets are varves. However, additional data is required to confirm this. The observed mean accumulation rate (1.6 mm yr^-1^), the variance in accumulation rates and the low-frequency trends in grain size are important indicators of late Holocene environmental change at a temporal resolution of at least ~100 years.
  5. Intervals of peak glacier extent, such as during the First Millennial Advance (~200 to 700 CE) and Little Ice Age (~1600 to 1900 CE) are best correlated with grain size in Cariboo Lake. The trends in varve thickness were not as strong but still help confirm trends observed in grain size. Organic matter content is the least correlated with the other sediment metrics and may be more sensitive to vegetation changes in the basin. We conclude that sediment accumulation in Cariboo Lake was more sensitive to glacier activity and sediment production during the LIA compared to earlier advances. The greatest deviation in varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter above normal occurs after 1860 CE and is most likely related to climate warming following the LIA.
  6. Upstream filtering and storage of glacier eroded sediment likely dampened the hydroclimatic sediment signal retried from Cariboo Lake but also allowed for a longer temporal record to be retrieved. Despite some upstream filtering, the Cariboo Lake sediment record has a better temporal resolution compared to other available records in the Interior Ranges of British Columbia. Longer cores from the accessible Cariboo Lake could yield a higher resolution Holocene record sediment delivery and glacier changes for the interior of BC.

# Figure Captions

Figure 1: Map of the Cariboo Lake basin and surrounding area. The inset map shows the location of the Cariboo Lake basin within British Columbia relative to the Mud Lake basin from the Hodder et. al, (2006) study. The map coordinate reference system is NAD83 - BC Albers.

Figure 2: Map of the Cariboo Lake bathymetry and coring locations. Bathymetric interval is 10 m. Acoustic transects selected for analysis are shown with a black solid line and labeled A, B, C, D, E and F. Fan deltas mentioned in the text are represented by black triangles and are refered to by the upstream creek. The map coordinate reference system is NAD83 - UTM zone 10N.

Figure 3: 1971-2000 monthly runoff statistics for Water Survey of Canada station 08KH003 (A) and 1971-2000 temperature and precipitation normals from Environment Canada station 1094616 (B). The top of each bar on panel C corresponds to the average monthly total precipitation and the coloured portion shows the fraction of rain or snow.

Figure 4: Panel of six sub-bottom acoustic transects A, B, C, D, E, and F. The left-hand side of each transect corresponds to the north-shore of the lake, see Figure 2 for location of each transect. Transect A and B: Acoustic echo (multiple) is denoted by (i). Transect C: (i) denotes inferred bedrock or coarse late-glacial material. (ii) and (iii) are v-notch scour channels. (A) and (B) are sediment facies. Transect D: Scour channels are denoted by (i) and (ii). Slumping is observed at (iii).

Figure 5: Sediment characteristics from the Ekman surficial bulk samples with distance down lake from the Cariboo River input to Cariboo Lake. Top panel A is the percent clay (0.01 - 2) µm, silt (2 - 63) µm, and sand grains (63 - 2000) µm, panel B is the  D~10~, D~50~, and D~90~ (µm) grain size, panel C is the mean laminae thickness (mm), and the bottom panel D is percent organic matter content (OM).

Figure 6: Selected surficial sub-cores from Ekman dredge samples. A (E1), is proximal to the Cariboo River delta (0.3 km down lake). B (E13), was retrieved from the second deepest basin in the lake in the Cariboo River basin (5.24 km down lake). C (E18), was retrieved from the Keithley Creek sub-basin (29.53 km down lake).

Figure 7: Age-depth model for cores V1 (orange) and V2 (blue). The median calibrated ^14^C AMS chronologies are shown with a solid line and the organic samples used for AMS analysis are shown with a dot. The varve-based chronologies from lamanae couplet counting and thicknesses measurements are shown using a dotted line. Turbidite events are shown as solid triangles and were excised from the varve-based chronology. The error bars on the median calibrated ^14^C dates are the two-sigma uncertainty range and the grey shading around the varve points is the 10% counting error. Gaps between the varve chronology (points) denote periods that had indiscernable varves. The inset graph on the upper right hand side of the figure shows the begining of the record in higher detail including the varve-based chronology for the Ekman surficial core (E13) which has a maximum observed depth of 9 cm.

Figure 8: Photographs of the long core stratigraphy. A, Example of regular laminae from V1 at a depth of 360 cm. B, a graded event-based turbidite bed from V2 at a depth of 230 cm. Features labeled within this figure include: ‘a’ high flow spring/summer freshet laminae, ‘b’ low flow winter laminae, ‘c’  top of the turbidite bed, and ‘d’ the bottom of the turbidite bed. C, shows massive beds ‘e’ over more distict laminations ‘f’.

Figure 9: Standardized departure from the mean varve thickness (VT) for cores V1 and V2. Events are removed from the record and disturbed facies are shown as blank gaps in the record. The gap width of disturbed facies was calculated using a linear interpolation from the ^14^C dates. The gray lines represent measured varve thickness at couplet (annual) resolution where available, the black line is a 30-year moving average. Gaps correspond to portions of the core that did not have discernible varves. The bottom axes, labeled Year (CE), was estimated using linear interpolation from the median calibrated ^14^C age. Laminae counting in V1 was not possible beyond the estimated date of 1900 CE and beyond 1970 CE in V2. The black X's on the bottom graph of V1 and V2 denote the ^14^C age and depth of the respective sample.

Figure 10: Standardized departure from the mean D~50~ grain size for cores V1 and V2. The points represent D~50~ grain size at 2.5 - 5 cm intervals and the lines represent the 3 sample (75 year) moving average. The top axes, labeled Year (CE), was estimated using linear interpolation from the median calibrated ^14^C age.

Figure 11: Standardized departure from the mean percent organic matter (OM) for cores V1 and V2. The points represent percent OM at 2.5 - 5 cm intervals and the lines represent the 3 sample (75 year) moving average. The top axes, labelelled Year (CE), was estimated using linear interpolation from the median calibrated ^14^C age.

Figure 12: Cariboo Lake sediment characteristics for cores V1 (purple) and V2 (green) and Northern Hemisphere (NH) climate proxies. A, is the standardized departure (Sd. Dept.) from the mean varve thickness (VT) for annual couplets (light colour) and 30-year moving average (dark lines). B, is the standardized departure from the mean percent organic matter (OM) for cores V1 and V2. The coloured dots represent percent OM at 2.5 - 5 cm intervals and the coloured lines are the 3 sample (75 year) moving average. C, is the standardized departure from the mean D~50~ grain size, the coloured dots represent D~50~ grain size at 5 - 10 cm intervals and the coloured lines are the 3 sample (125 year) moving average. D, Solomina et al. (2016) reconstructed relative glacier extent in western North America (black line), expansion of the Castle Creek glacier (blue bars, Maurer et al., 2012), and periods of peak glacier extent in western Canada (gray bars, Solomina et al., 2016). E, Moberg et al. (2005) Nothern Hemisphere annual temperature anomaly from the 1961-1990 mean, the orange line is the full reconstruction from high and low frequency proxies, and the black line is the low frequency proxy component with upper and lower uncertainty marked by dashed blue lines. MCA is the Medieval Climatic Anomaly and LIA is the Little Ice Age. F, Ljungqvist et al. (2016) Nothern Hemisphere hydroclimate variability, expressed as standardized unitless anomalies ranging from -2 to 2, relative to the centennial mean and standard deviation over the eleventh-nineteenth centuries (see methods in Ljungqvist et al. 2016).\pagebreak
