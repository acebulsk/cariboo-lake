## Sub-bottom Acoustics

Acoustic stratigraphy from six selected transects (see locations in @fig-map-lake) reveal the range of morphologies and character of infilling sedimentary deposits in Cariboo Lake (@fig-acoustics). Acoustic penetration is limited in transects A and E by coarse sediments proximal to river fan-deltas across Cariboo Lake (see triangle symbols in @fig-map-lake for fan-delta locations). Acoustic signal penetration, resolution and distinctive acoustic layering improves significantly along the thalweg of the lake bottom away from the main Cariboo River delta and in cross-lake transects more distal from the valley-side fan-deltas. The diagonal lines across all panels (cross-hatching) in @fig-acoustics is observed over most of the acoustic record due to errant electrical interference from the research vessel that could not be resolved. However, the interference does not affect the overall quality of the acoustic results in the six selected transects (@fig-acoustics, A-F).

Acoustically penetrable, well-layered sediment is observed 3.5 km from the Cariboo River delta in transect B (@fig-acoustics, B). This site is proximal to long core V1. Acoustic reflectors with 1-2 m separation lie conformably over a hummocky basement which is observed on the south side of the transect (@fig-acoustics, B - i). The acoustic basement drops off below the observable record near the south channel-like depression. Well structured layering extends across the south side of the transect but pinches out towards the north shore (@fig-acoustics, B, C & D). On the south side of transect B, the thickness of the well structured layering ranges from 10 to 20 m. Underlying the layered sediments is a more massively layered facies which ranges from 12 to 25 m thick before the record is cut off at 80 m; the maximum depth of the acoustic record.

Acoustic penetration in the acoustic record increases 4.5 km from the Cariboo River delta along transect C and reaches a maximum sediment thickness of 35 m (@fig-acoustics, C). The acoustic basement is interpreted to be either bedrock or coarse-grained glacial sediment from the Last Glacial Maximum (@fig-acoustics, C â€“ i). Two sediment facies are observed across this transect based on geometry and the strength and continuity of reflectors. The lower unit, facies A, has a thickness of ~12 m along undisturbed sections (@fig-acoustics, C - A) and is more massive to weakly acoustically layered. The unconformities are most apparent in the two sharp crested v-notch channels at the middle of the transect. These channels are a continuation of those noted in transect B. These are interpreted to be scour channels formed by erosive, higher energy, turbidity currents that probably date to deglaciation of the lake basin. Facies A is comprised of a lighter grey tone representing coarse-grained sediment and lacks parallel reflectors indicating a higher energy and more rapid deposition of coarser lacustrine sediment. Facies B begins with high-amplitude parallel reflectors with 2-3 m separation and conforms well with facies A below (@fig-acoustics, C). Facies B has a thickness of ~10 m along undisturbed sections and deepens to a maximum of 13 m within two deeper scour channels (@fig-acoustics, C - ii & iii).
