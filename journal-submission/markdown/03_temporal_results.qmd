## Sediment Accumulation Chronology

Four vibra sediment cores, ranging from 2 – 4 m in length, were retrieved from the deepest portions of Cariboo Lake (Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}). Cores V1 (3 m) and V2 (4 m) in the main Cariboo River basin were selected for detailed analysis as these two cores had organic material for AMS radiocarbon dating, and their sediment stratigraphy was well preserved. The chronology of the two cores is provided by **two** AMS radiocarbon dates and laminae counting. A search for volcanic tephra was made through careful magnified inspection of visual colour changes. None were found using this method. @Westgate1977, @Hallett1997 and @Maurer2012b indicate that this area of British Columbia has had episodic volcanic ash inputs from significant eruptions that predate 2100 years BP but nothing since.

### Chronology  

Organic material for dating in the clastic dominated cores was extremely limited. AMS radiocarbon dates obtained for cores V1 and V2 are presented in Table \ref{tab:amsDates} and provide limited temporal control and evidence of sediment accumulation rates for the long cores. A small twig from V1 at 343 cm and combination of a **conifer needle and twig** which were combined into one sample at V2, with an average depth of 281 cm, yielding a calibrated [@Reimer2020] two-sigma date range of 1743-1884 cal BP and 1874-2044 cal BP respectively. Figure \ref{fig:amsRates} shows the ^14^C chronology for V1 and V2 compared to the laminae couplet chronologies for E13, V1, and V2. The ^14^C dates from samples V1 and V2 yield accumulation rates of 1.81 $\pm$ 0.07 mm yr^-1^ and 1.37 $\pm$ 0.05 mm yr^-1^ respectively.

Ekman surficial core 13 (E13) is most proximal to the V2 long core (see Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}) and exhibits similar sediment accumulation compared to the ^14^C and laminae chronology of V2 (Figure \ref{fig:amsRates}). The light-dark couplets in E13, are similar to annual deposits noted in dozens of other lakes throughout BC [e.g. @Hodder2006b] (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanImgs}). Therefore, the couplets within the Ekman cores are assumed to closely approximate varves, in which case E13 exhibits an average accumulation rate of 1.98 $\pm$ 0.19 mm yr^-1^. Higher accumulation rates are expected for the Ekman samples as they are not subjected to the same level of compaction as is deeper sediment in the long cores. The consistency of the E13 inferred accumulation rate when compared with two of the AMS dates from the V1 and V2 cores (Figure \ref{fig:amsRates}) are additional evidence of the varved nature of the sediment record.

```

By comparison with nearby lakes, accumulation rates in areas proximal to river inputs in nearby Quesnel Lake were measured to be about 0.72 mm yr^-1^ (see Figure 9 in @Gilbert2012). Sediment inputs are expected to be lower in Quesnel Lake compared to Cariboo Lake, with more arid and less glaciated portions of the Quesnel Lake watershed contributing to that lower rate. The AMS accumulation rates of 1.81 $\pm$ 0.07 mm yr^-1^ and 1.37 $\pm$ 0.05 mm yr^-1^ in Cariboo Lake are as expected for a smaller watershed with a higher fraction of glacier cover compared to Quesnel Lake. The AMS radiocarbon dates from samples V1 and V2 provide an important control when interpreting the inferred temporal pattern of sediment inputs to Cariboo Lake.

Three distinct sediment facies were observed in both V1 and V2: discernible couplets, indiscernible couplets (disturbed facies) and graded turbidite events. The similarity in couplet structure and thickness between cores V1 and V2 and hydrology of Cariboo Lake strongly suggested these are varves. This interpretation is also supported by the two AMS radiocarbon dated samples from cores V1 and V2 which corresponded reasonably well with the couplet count chronology at the same depth (Figure \ref{fig:amsRates}). **Differences between the two chronologies were expected due to uncertainties with couplet counting and AMS radiocarbon dating**. The uncertainty of the laminae counting method is inferred from Ekman surface cores by counting laminae down to a common specified depth of 5 cm for three Ekman cores (E12, E13, E14 - see Figure \ref{fig:map-lake} for locations proximal to V1 and V2). The Ekman laminae counting analysis resulted in an uncertainty estimate of the counting method of about 10% or 1 miscounted varve per 10 years. This counting error of 10% is higher than the varve counting error of 0.7% in @Menounos2008c and 0.7-6% in @Zolitschka1991. In @Menounos2008c and @Zolitschka1991 varves were identified using thin sections and may have contributed to a more accurate chronology. The varve contacts observed in Cariboo Lake were strong and there is reasonable confidence in counting. Missing varves may have occurred if spring high flows did not deliver a coarse-grained laminae and false varves may occur if multiple high flows are observed in a given year. However, the consistent **spring** flows of this basin suggest multiple high flow events are rare (Figure \ref{fig:cl-hydro}). This hypothesis is also supported by Figure \ref{fig:amsRates} which shows a negative bias of the varve chronology compared to the calibrated ^14^C age-depth model and suggests that missing varves may be a larger source of error than false varves.

Instantaneously deposited (event-based) turbidites were identified if laminae/beds had D~50~ grain size greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean and/or thickness greater than 6 standard deviations for V1 and 2 standard deviations for V2 from the mean. Figure \ref{fig:varve-turb} examples show the difference in regular laminae compared to an event-based turbidite bed. Turbidite beds observed in V1 and V2 were well defined and graded (see Figure \ref{fig:varve-turb}, d). These turbidite beds are similar in structure to those described in @sabatier2022 as originating from a flood, glacial lake outburst flood, or delta collapse event. Since the Cariboo River upstream of Cariboo Lake is filtered by headwater proglacial lakes, it is more likely the turbidite beds at the distal V1 and V2 site are from localized sidewall tributary floods. Collapse of the foreslope of an oversteppened Cariboo delta is also possible.

knitr::include_graphics("figs/good_vs_flood_vs_disturbed_varves_.png")
```

Where possible the thickness, grain size statistics, and percent organic matter (OM) were analyzed for each event layer. The turbidite bed grain size, OM, and thickness illustrates the high sediment flux during these events compared to the regular, annually occurring couplets (Table \ref{tab:turbTbl}). The composition of sediment grains within the event-based layers were all characterized by a coarser single mode with less than 0.01% clay, over 98% silt and less than 1% sand. The grain size distribution for the regular couplet sediments is characterized by a bi-modal distribution with an average composition of 16% clay, 83% silt, and less than 1% sand. Figure \ref{fig:turbScatter} shows that some event layers are coincident in time between V1 and V2. Since each of the event-based layers contain sediment deposited over a single, potentially localized event, they were removed from subsequent trend analyses of varve thickness, grain size, and percent organics.

The varve-based chronology is based on the counting of discernible couplets with graded turbidite facies removed. Indiscernible couplets in the disturbed-massive units makes interpreting the time elapsed over each of these units difficult (see Figure \ref{fig:varve-turb} C). To compensate for the depth intervals associated with the disturbed sections, a 30-year moving average of sediment accumulation rates from immediately above and below the disturbed sections were used to interpolate accumulation rates over each facies (see method described in Menounos et al., 2008). For core V1, laminae couplets were counted down to a core depth of 343 cm, where the AMS radiocarbon organic material was retrieved. This resulted in a V1 couplet-derived age estimated of 1419 $\pm$ 142 varve BP compared to the two-sigma calibrated ^14^C age range of 1820-1918 cal BP. For core V2 a date of 1792 $\pm$ 180 varve BP was estimated by couplet counting down to a core depth of 281 cm which matches more closely with two-sigma calibrated ^14^C age range of 1895-2043 cal BP. The better alignment between the couplet counting age and the AMS derived age in V2 can be attributed to the higher degree of core disturbance in V1 compared to V2. Sections that had indiscernible couplets may have resulted in some undercounting within core V1. **While there is substantial uncertainty in both the varve counting and AMS radiocarbon dating methods, the overlap in the uncertainty bounds in Figure \ref{fig:amsRates} for V2 and general agreement between the two chronologies for V1 suggests the laminae couples may be deposited annually. Additional \textsuperscript{14}C analysis is required to conclusively determine the couplets are varves, however the majority of evidence presented here suggests this is the case.**

```{r turbScatter, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, echo = F, fig.cap = "Timing and Standardized Departures of turbidite thickness, grain size, and OM for V1 and V2. Year (CE) is the estimated year using linear interpolation from the AMS radiocarbon dates.\\label{turbScatter}"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/turbidite_plot.jpg')
```

The basal age for each core is estimated using both the varve counting method and using a linear interpolation to extrapolate the ^14^C chronology. The basal age of V1 at 378 cm is approximately 1537 $\pm$ 154 varve yr BP based on the varve chronology and the two-sigma calibrated ^14^C range is 1931-2086 cal BP. The basal age of V2 at 282 cm is about 1797 $\pm$ 180 varve yr BP based on the varve chronology and the two-sigma calibrated ^14^C range is 1902-2051 cal BP. **The closer alignment of the \textsuperscript{14}C** and varve chronology at V2 gives greater confidence in the V2 age model used for reconstructing the timing of Holocene sedimentation patterns for this core. Since V1 has a greater spread between the two chronologies, there is less confidence in the chronology of this core. However, given the physical mechanisms that control sedimentation in Cariboo Lake it is likely both cores primarily contain couplets that are deposited annually.

### Sediment Laminae Statistics

A time series of varve thickness (as standardized departures) is presented in Figure \ref{fig:varves-a}, using only discernible couplets. Event-based turbidites have been removed and indiscernible facies are represented as gaps. The chronology for this time series was derived using a linear interpolation from the median calibrated ^14^C date of each core (Table \ref{tab:amsDates}). The mean varve thickness for V1 is 2.4 mm and for V2 is 1.5 mm. Thicker varves are expected at V1 due to its closer proximity to the Cariboo River delta. This is also supported by the thicker varves observed in core E11 (proximal to V1) compared to E13 (proximal to V2) of 2.8 mm to 2.0 mm respectively. The time series of varve thickness measured from V1 and V2 illustrates trends in suspended sediment delivery to Cariboo Lake (Figure \ref{fig:varves-a}). The measured couplet thicknesses in the two cores are plotted as standardized departures to facilitate comparison between the two cores. In each plot a 30-year moving average with a 1-year time step is plotted in black to emphasize decadal to centennial patterns in accumulation rate departures. The 30-year average varve thickness **are largely** above average from 0 to 750 CE, for both V1 and V2, with a stronger signal observed for V1 which is closer to the main Cariboo River outlet. Below average varve thickness is observed at both V1 and V2 from 750-1600 CE. After 1600 CE, trends in varve thickness between the two cores depart, with V2 above average during the Little Ice Age and V1 remains below average. Sub-centennial trends are not reported due to the coarse temporal control for both V1 and V2.

```

#### Grain Size

The mean D~50~ grain size is 7.6 $\pm$ 0.01 µm at V1 compared to 6.3 $\pm$ 0.01 µm at V2. The larger grain size and varve thickness at V1 compared to V2 is consistent with the spatial trends in sediment delivery observed from the Ekman cores. While based on a limited number of measurements compared to the varve thickness analysis, the temporal pattern in standardized departures of D~50~ grain size between the two cores shows a consistent pattern (Figure \ref{fig:particle}). Both V1 and V2 have above average grain size between 0 to 700 CE and below average from 700 to 1500 CE. After 1500 CE, grain size follows an increasing trend with average to above average grain size. V1 shows an earlier increase in grain size compared to V2. While couplet thickness does not increase substantially over the LIA interval, gain size does. Overall, grain size fluctuations at a temporal resolution of about 100-years shows good correspondence between the two cores over the last 2000 years.

```

#### Organic Matter

The average percent organic matter (OM) at V1 and V2 is similar at 4.76% and 4.80%, respectively, suggesting that the flux of allochthonous organic material to the core locations is not dependent on distance from the main Cariboo River as it is easily transported through the lake due to low density. This is also supported by the Ekman OM spatial analysis, where a systematic down-lake relationship was not observed (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}, C). Figure \ref{fig:loi} shows the percent OM for both V1 and V2. Higher levels of organic content are shown in V1 and V2 from 0-1000 CE and mostly below average from 1000-2000 CE. Specific periods of above average OM for V1 occur around CE 50-500, 650-1150, around 1300 and 1750-1850. OM in V2 matches above average values in the interval CE 250-550 and 650-950.
