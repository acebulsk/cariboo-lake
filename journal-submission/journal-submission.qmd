abstract: "An acoustic record of sedimentation and sediment cores from Cariboo Lake are analyzed to present a high-resolution record of sediment accumulation. Acoustically penetrable sediment reaches a maximum thickness of 35 m in deep parts of the lake, representing deglacial and Holocene accumulation. A transition from massive to well-layered sediments is observed in the sub-bottom acoustic record during final phases of valley deglaciation in the region (ca. 10.5-9 ka BP). **The timing of this transition is inferred from the sediment core chronology proximal to the acoustic transects.** Fine clastic sediments produced from the glaciated headwaters are delivered by Cariboo River as over-flow currents into the lake which produce bimodal rhythmic layering of silt and clay sediments. Laminae couplets are inferred to be deposited annually according to two AMS radiocarbon dates and a varve counting chronology. Two long cores, 2.9 and 3.8 m in length, were selected for analysis with estimated basal dates of 2 ka BP. The accumulation of sediment into Cariboo Lake shows above average sediment accumulation rates between 0-700CE and 1500-2017CE which are coincident with cool temperatures and peak glacier extents. Cariboo Lake is situated in the northern Columbia Mountains, British Columbia, Canada and is representative of environments transitioning from semi-arid interior climates to glaciated high mountain regions to the east. The sediment chronology presented in this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge of lake sediment accumulation and Holocene watershed activity for this transitional climate region of western Canada."

# Introduction

Environmental proxies that extend back beyond the modern observable record are crucial to understanding earth system processes [@Turney2019; @Huber2012; @Nelson2016]. Proxy reconstructions at the sub-annual scale (e.g. ice cores, tree rings, and corals), to multi-decadal scales (e.g. sediments, pollen, boreholes) have proven useful in describing past environmental conditions across the globe [@Masson2013]. In the case of sedimentary sequences collected from climate sensitive glaciated watersheds, they have been important in contributing to the regional understanding of climate and hydrologic variability over the Holocene. **For example, researchers have utilized sedimentary sequences along with other environmental proxy methods to provide regional [@Menounos2009b] and global [@Neukom2019] reconstructions of hydroclimatic change over the Holocene.**

Climatic variability in western Canada over the Holocene contributed to several fluctuations in glacial activity with implications for sediment accumulation in glacier-fed lakes. Multi-proxy analyses of lake sediments from Vancouver Island [@Brown2006], south central British Columbia [@Lowe1997] and northern Washington State [@Steinman2019] suggest low lake levels and precipitation amounts during the early Holocene around 11.0 to 7.50 ka. **In the southern Coast Mountains [@Menounos2004; @Koch2007a; @Osborn2007] and Canadian Rocky Mountains [@Luckman1988; @Luckman1993; @Luckman1993a] glacier extents were generally reduced during the early Holocene relative to late Holocene extents. During the Early Neoglacial (7.50-5.00 ka), a relatively small expansion of glaciers is reported in the south Coast Mountains [@Osborn2007; @Filippelli2006; @Ryder1986; @Harvey2012] and in the Interior ranges and Rocky Mountains [@Luckman1993].** During the Early-middle Neoglacial (5.00-3.50 ka), there is widespread evidence of at least two glacial advances across western Canada from material dated in glacial forefields and glacier-fed lakes [@Koch2007a; @Osborn2007; @Menounos2008c; @Gardner1985; @Wood2004; @Hodder2006b; @Desloges1999; @Leonard1999]. **During the Middle-late Neoglacial (3.50-1.00 ka), two periods of glacier advance have been reported. In the central and eastern ranges of Canada, extensive glacier coverage around 3.5-2.77 ka and 1.8-1.5 ka is inferred from lacustrine sediment records [@Leonard1999; @Leonard1997; @Dirszowsky1997a; @Desloges1999] and log and stump material [@Wood2004; @Luckman1995; @Luckman1999]. Glacier advances during the Little Ice Age (LIA) have been reported as broadly synchronous from Alaska to Patagonia [@Luckman2000g]. In the Canadian Rocky Mountains many glaciers reached peak glacier extents during the LIA, centered around 1250 CE [@Luckman1995; @Osborn2001; @Leonard1997] and 1850 CE [@Luckman2000g; @Leonard1997]. There is general regional agreement on the timing and magnitude of the large Early Holocene retreat and Late Holocene LIA advance; however, the smaller fluctuations that occurred between these large events have less regional agreement [@Menounos2009b].** 

In the western Cordillera of Canada, sedimentary sequences have been collected to better understand the hydroclimatic and glacial history of the Coast Mountains [@Menounos2008c], St. Elias Mountains [@Crookshanks2008], Monashee Mountains [@Hodder2006b], and Rocky Mountains [@Leonard1986; @Dirszowsky1997a; @Desloges1999]. **A study by @Gilbert2012 of Quesnel Lake (272 km^2^), 30 km south of the study area examined here, found high rates of sediment accumulation around 10.4 ka BP during the early Holocene deglacial environment, and around 8.4 ka BP sediment accumulation declined significantly. Meaningful trends in organic matter and grain size of Quesnel Lake sediment sequences at a sub-millennial time scale were not detectable. Quesnel Lake is very large relative to the contributing watershed and therefore the sediment system exhibited very low accumulation rates and is much less sensitive to climate variability.** Within the Cariboo Lake basin, @Maurer2012b investigated On-off Lake which remained intermittently connected to the Castle Creek Glacier on the basin divide (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}). Currently the Castle Creek Glacier resides outside of the Cariboo Lake basin however @Maurer2012b provide evidence that the glacier advanced across the hydrological divide and into the Cariboo Lake basin several times over the Holocene. Advances of the Castle Creek Glacier into the Cariboo Lake basin occurred around around 4.96-4.45, 2.73-2.49, 1.87-1.72, and 1.54-1.42 ka BP [@Maurer2012b]. Both @Gilbert2012 and @Maurer2012b provide a long but coarse resolution record of the fluvial and glacial activity of the Cariboo Mountains. Additional high-resolution records for this transitional climate between the wetter Coastal and dyer Rocky Mountain ranges are needed especially for the mid to late Holocene interval where greater regional variability in glacial responses to climate change has been observed [@Menounos2009b].

**The sensitivity and temporal resolution of lake sediment characteristics (e.g. varves thickness, grain size and organic content) and their connection to regional hydrology, temperature, precipitation patterns, and glacier extent varies amongst glacier-fed lake studies [@Desloges1999; @Hodder2006b; @Leonard1997; @Menounos2006b; @Menounos2008c].** Mountain basins that exhibit a strong nival-hydrographic regime typically produce distinct varve couplets with a fine-grained layer deposited in winter when the lake ices over and flow velocity decreases followed by a coarse-grained layer deposited during spring high flows [e.g. @Leonard1997; @Hodder2007c; @Desloges1999]. In contrast, lakes proximal to the Coast Mountains of British Columbia typically show greater variability in varve thickness due to the influence of frequent and large fall rain-storms that produce multiple coarse laminations within a single season [e.g. @Gilbert1997; @Menounos2008c]. Lakes that are more distal from glacier sources typically have relatively lower sediment inputs and finer grain sizes, due to the upstream filtering of river floodplains and lakes [@Hodder2007c]. The effect of this filtering can influence the climate and hydrology signals and may contribute to a weaker signal to noise ratio and reduced sensitivity to hydroclimatic variability [@Jerolmack2010].

Establishing a correlation between seasonal or annual trends in varve thickness, grain size, and organic content from sediment cores to local discharge, temperature, and precipitation is not always possible for short time scales due to complex process interactions, watershed connectivity **and dating uncertainties** [@Hodder2007c; @Menounos2008c; @Heideman2017]. **The linkage between hydrology and climate drivers and the lake sediment record may be limited at short time scales (i.e. less than 10 years) if there is a weak connectivity between sediment production and delivery to the lake [@Hodder2007c; @Menounos2008c; @Heideman2017]. Trends in lake sediment sequences are typically more representative of climate fluctuations at longer time scales greater than 100 years as this provides sufficient time for changes in sediment production and delivery to propagate through the watershed [@Leonard1999; @Osborn2007; @Heideman2017]. Shorter timescale trends in climate change may still be reflected in lake sediment records but with less fidelity and confidence in the chronology.**

Sediment chronologies in clastic lake sediments are typically derived from a combination of radiocarbon dating [@Gilbert2012; @Hodder2006b; @Steinman2019], identification of volcanic tephra layers [@Gilbert2012; @Hodder2006b; @Steinman2019] and counting of visible annual laminations (varves) [@Hodder2006b; @Heideman2015]. The Mt. Mazama volcanic eruption is the most prominent tephra layer typically found in sediment sequences in western Canada [@Gilbert2012; @Steinman2019] and has been dated to approximately 7600 cal. BP [@Zdanowicz1999; @Hallett1997]. **@Westgate1977 reports the most recent major volcanic ash event to reach central BC occurred 2100 yr BP.** 

Few sedimentary sequences exist in central British Columbia that provide a high-resolution and long-term record of hydroclimatic variability [@Gilbert2012; @Hodder2006b; @Menounos2009b; @Maurer2012b]. The sedimentary sequence from Cariboo Lake presented here, fills this gap by providing a new record of Holocene hydroclimatic variability for the transitional zone between the Coastal and Rocky Mountains. The purpose of this research is to 1) establish an understanding of the mechanisms that control the delivery and deposition of the fine sediment fraction to Cariboo Lake, 2) to reconstruct the highest resolution and longest possible sediment accumulation record from cores and acoustic methods for this area of British Columbia, 3) compare and contrast the accumulation record in this transitional (semi-arid to glaciated mountainous) lake system with existing sedimentary sequences and regional climate proxies in western Canada.

# Study Area

Cariboo Lake is located in the northern foothills of the Columbia Mountains, 85 km northeast of Williams Lake, British Columbia (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}). The lake receives runoff from an area of 3244 km^2^, which is filtered by three deep fjord like lakes: Issac Lake, Lanezi Lake, and Ghost Lake (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}). The watershed relief ranges from 2600 m asl. in the eastern headwaters to 600 m asl. at the western Cariboo Lake outlet. The west to east, 90 km long watershed spans a precipitation gradient ranging from 1370 mm yr^-1^ in the headwaters to 477 mm yr^-1^ at the semi-arid outlet to the lake. The area of Cariboo Lake is 10 km^2^ resulting in a lake area-to-watershed area ratio of 0.3%. The Cariboo Lake watershed has 64 km^2^ of permanent ice cover which covers 2% of the total watershed [@Bolch2008]. The most extensive glaciated terrain is proximal to Mt. Lunn roughly 60 km upstream of Cariboo Lake (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}). The Cariboo Lake basin hydrology is snow- and glacier-melt dominant with average 1971-2000 monthly runoff peaking in June and low-flows that occur between December and March (Figure \ref{fig:cl-hydro}, A). From December to March the air temperature is mostly below 0 $^{\circ}$C and precipitation falls primarily as snow during these months (Figure \ref{fig:cl-hydro}).

The Cariboo River, draining into the east margin of the lake, is the main source of sediment. The lake is separated into two basins by a large alluvial fan building cross-valley from Keithley Creek (Figure \ref{fig:map-lake}). The surface area of the upstream basin is 8 km^2^ and is referred to here as the main Cariboo Lake basin. The downstream basin, referred to here as the Keithley Creek sub-basin, is 2 km^2^ in surface area. The bathymetry of the lake reaches a maximum depth of over 50 m in two deep holes within the central part of the main Cariboo Lake basin. These deep holes provide some evidence of past glacial scouring and ice extents that reached the lake.

**Lanezi Lake is a deep fjord-like lake with flat bathymetry reaching a maximum depth of 170 m and Sandy Lake is much shallower reaching a maximum depth of 6 m (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}). The Matthews River, which meets the Cariboo River below Lanezi Lake, is filtered by Ghost Lake and provides an important connection to meltwater sources draining several alpine glaciers including the largest area of ice (10 km^2^) in the Cariboo Lake watershed, proximal to Roberts Peak (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}).**

# Methods

## Field Methods

A field campaign was conducted during the summer of 2017 to collect sub-bottom acoustic soundings, dredge samples, and sediment cores. Thirty-four km of sub-bottom acoustic soundings were collected across Cariboo Lake using a 10 kHz StrataBox 3510 HD. An Ekman dredge was used to collect 20 samples from the lake bottom, each yielding ~730 cm^3^ of surficial sediment. The dredge samples were sub-sampled in the field using an 80 mm diameter PVC cylinder pushed into the block of sediment. This resulted in 20 short cores each containing about 450 cm^3^ of sediment. The Ekman dredge filled with variable depths of sediment and as a result the short cores ranged from 6 to 12 cm in length. The remaining sediment not captured in the PVC cylinder was kept as a bulk sediment sample. Four long sediment cores (V1-V4) were collected using a Rossfelder submersible vibracorer with a 6 m long 70 mm diameter aluminum pipe. The Ekman short cores and the long vibracores were split longitudinally with one half preserved as an archive and the other as a working half. The working half samples were prepared for imaging by scraping the core parallel to the sediment laminae to create a flat surface which showed the sediment stratigraphy. The stratigraphy of long cores V1 and V2 were selected for detailed analysis as they were located within the deepest parts of upper Cariboo Lake. The deep mid-lake sampling locations were important to ensure the cores consisted of a higher fraction of fine clastic sediments from the main Cariboo River compared to coarser sediments derived from steep valley sidewalls and turbidite flood events. Cores V3 and V4 taken at shallower depths further down-lake had higher fractions of coarse grained sediments and resulted in a higher degree of core disturbance, presumably due to the lower cohesion of the coarser grained sediments.

## Laboratory Methods

The cores and short cores were analyzed for laminae thickness, organic content, and particle size. The working halves of long cores V1 and V2 were subsampled with 2 cm^3^ of sediment extracted at a 5 cm interval, with additional samples taken within stratigraphic facies. Stratigraphic **facies** were identified based on visual changes in grain size and lamination patterns. Laminae couplets observed on the working halves were digitally counted and measured for thickness using the ImageJ software, by @Schneider2012. Uncertainty in laminae counting is attributed to sections of core with indiscernible laminae formation, core compaction, undercounting, and subjectivity in classifying the occasionally thicker (4 to 47 mm thick) graded to massive laminae/beds. Varve counting uncertainties in the literature are reported as ranging between 0.7 - 6 % [@Menounos2008c; @Zolitschka1991]. The uncertainty of the laminae counting in this study was inferred from Ekman short cores (E12, E13, E14) which had statistically similar sediment accumulation rates. **The varve counting error was estimated by counting the number of couplets down to a depth of 5 cm in each Ekman core. This resulted in an average count of 11.33 couplets and a standard deviation of 1.15 between the three short cores (see Table \ref{tab:ekErr}). The top section of cores V1 and V2 were disturbed during coring which prevented counting and measurement of laminae couplets in 11 cm of V1 and 7 cm of V2. The absence of clear marker laminae and limited overlap between the long cores and short cores prevented anchoring of the long cores to the short cores.** 

Organic content was **approximated** from percent weight loss-on-ignition analysis (550 $^{\circ}$C) [@Dean1974; @Smith2003]. Grain size analysis was conducted using a Mastersizer Particle Size Analyzer 3000. Samples were prepared following methods by @Gray2010 to remove the fine fraction of particles from organic material. This involved a removal of organic material using three sequential alloquots of 20% H~2~0~2~ until the sample stopped reacting. To prevent flocculation of sediment grains the samples were dispersed in 0.05% solution of **sodium hexametaphosphate** for 24 hours. Grain size was measured three times for each sample, resulting in an average standard deviation of $\pm$ 0.01 µm. 

The chronology of both vibra cores was reconstructed using AMS ^14^C dating (analyzed at the Andre E. Lalonde AMS Laboratory at the University of Ottawa) and a chronology derived from laminae (couplet) counting on working core images. The AMS ^14^C calibration was performed using Bchron, a Baysesian statistical age-model software package for R [@Parnell2008; @Parnell2011; @Haslett2008] and the IntCal20 calibration curve [@Reimer2020].

# Discussion

Cariboo Lake was selected to test the utility of moderate sized glacier-fed lakes as archives of accessible long-term and high-resolution sediment input variability. Evidence of late Pleistocene deglaciation in the Cariboo Lake region is provided by coarse temporal resolution sub-bottom acoustic results. A maximum deglacial sediment thickness of ~35 m puts Cariboo Lake in the middle to lower range of Holocene sediment inputs in Canadian Cordilleran lakes [see detailed discussion in @Gilbert2012]. The study of smaller Mud Lake, in the Rocky Mountains to the east of Cariboo Lake (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin} – inset) was evaluated by @Hodder2006b, who found the early phases of deglaciation and lake sediment infill started just prior to 9.6 ka BP. @Gilbert2012 indicate deglaciation of the north and west arms of nearby Quesnel Lake was likely complete by 8.6 ka BP. **@Menounos2017 describe substantial loss of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet across western Canada as early as 14.0 ka BP**. The Cariboo Lake acoustic results contribute to this regional record however the inferred bottom dates present uncertainty in the actual timing. 

Unlike many other deglacial sediment packages in Canadian Cordilleran lakes, the sediment infill in Cariboo Lake has been subject to deep trenching during deglaciation and the early Holocene (Figure 3c). The troughs, with sediment infills occurring at different times, suggest the presence of highly erosive but intermittent bottom currents during deglaciation and **possibly** into the earliest Holocene. Energetic flow of cold sediment-rich meltwater flow would be required, suggesting proximity of an actively retreating valley glacier. The absence of lower elevations moraines in the valley upstream of Cariboo Lake might indicate rapidly retreating ice into headwater locations. However, in general, moraines indicative of stagnant ice fronts in lower elevation settings are not common elsewhere throughout much of the eastern Cordillera, suggesting that valley glacier development was limited [@Menounos2017].

In contemporary ice-proximal lakes with extensive coverage of active glaciers, high accumulation rates have been observed to be between 0.5 m yr^-1^ [@Crookshanks2008] and as high as 1 m yr^-1^ [@Gilbert1997]. Similar high accumulation rates in the late-glacial are inferred to have occurred in Quesnel Lake [@Gilbert2012], resulting in a thick pre-Holocene sediment package. This evidence for high pre/early Holocene accumulation rates in Quesnel Lake from large dynamic glaciers suggests that high accumulation rates are also likely for Cariboo Lake during this time and is supported by the acoustic data presented here. 

Two transects of sub-bottom acoustic records analyzed within Cariboo Lake provide evidence of high sediment accumulation rates during the early Holocene. Sub-bottom acoustic records from Transect B, which is proximal to the V1 core, indicate an upward transition from massive-unlayered (Facies A) to well-layered sediments (Facies B) at a depth of about 20 m (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}). Assuming a maximum Holocene sediment accumulation rate of approximately 1.9 mm yr^-1^ from V1, this would put this transition at about 10.5 ka BP. Transect C, is located in between cores V1 and V2, shows the transition of Facies A to B occurring at a depth of around 15 m (Figure \ref{fig:acoustics}). Using a combined V1 and V2 average Holocene sediment accumulation rate of 1.7 mm yr^-1^ in this region of the lake, puts the transition from Facies A to B at around 9 ka BP for Transect C, slightly later than the Transect B estimate. The massive structure of Facies A is inferred to be due to high rates of sediment delivery as glaciers retreated upvalley during the early Holocene after the formation of the deep trenches. The well-layered sediment of Facies B, along with the continuation of laminae couplets observed in cores V1 and V2 over the last 2 ka, suggests that glaciers reduced in extent at the start of the Holocene but did not disappear completely. It is possible during this transition from Facies A to B, glaciers retreated above Lanezi Lake resulting in more sediment filtering and thus a reduction in sediment delivery and the beginning of seasonally derived laminae couplet formation within Cariboo Lake.

**Prior to the Neoglacial, sediment accumulation rates are generally lower across western Canada due to reduced glacier extent and warm temperatures [@Menounos2004; @Koch2007a; @Osborn2007; @Luckman1988; @Luckman1993]. Therefore, the estimated basal ages of Facies A and B, determined from from sedimentation accumulation rates over the last 2 ka from the long cores presented here, may be much older if the actual sedimentation rates were slower as well.** The timing of the transition between these two facies is similar to the onset of deglaciation and start of the Holocene sediment package within Mud Lake, BC [@Hodder2006b] around 9.6 ka BP, at Moose Lake, BC [@Desloges1999] around 10.3 ka BP, at Quesnel Lake, BC [@Gilbert2012] around 8.6 ka BP, and at the Upper Bow River, AB [@Leonard1999] around 11.7 ka BP. Warming in the early Holocene, around 9.10-6.70 ka BP in the **Canadian Rockies**, specifically, [@Luckman1986] and British Columbia, generally, [@Clague1989; @Steinman2019] led to two possible sedimentation regimes. Where glaciers persist **in the Canadian Rockies through the warm period** resulting in more regular seasonality of sediment inputs and laminae couplet formation [e.g. Mud Lake, @Hodder2006b] and where glaciers disappear during the warm period, leading to much lower accumulation and seasonality [e.g. Moose Lake, @Desloges1999].

Records of sub-bottom acoustic records from Cariboo Lake present coarse temporal scale resolution of continuous sedimentation accumulation rates throughout the Holocene. Higher resolution AMS dated sediments from the much thinner sediment package in the west arm of Quesnel Lake, located in the Cariboo Mountains (Figure \ref{fig:map-basin}), also showed a very consistent mean rate of sedimentation throughout the entire Holocene [@Gilbert2012]. Contrasting somewhat from this pattern are results from @Menounos2004 and @Desloges1999 who note that early to mid-Holocene sediment accumulation rates in the southeastern Canadian Cordillera were lower than the late-Holocene Neoglacial period. However, those shifts come from watersheds with much higher percentages of glacier ice cover (~15-40%) coupled with the probable disappearance of glaciers during the warmer hypsithermal. **Therefore**, any extrapolation of timing to the **entire Holocene** sediment record of Cariboo Lake remains speculative.

Sediment inputs to Cariboo Lake are mainly delivered via the Cariboo River delta and thus changes in the whole of the Cariboo Lake watershed **would be expected** to be important. In contrast, inputs of sediment from the small tributary watersheds that boarder Cariboo Lake are controlled by more localized, watershed-specific responses. Although coarser grained sediments from discrete turbidite flows are found proximal to sidewall tributary deltas (Figure \ref{fig:ekmanSeds}), they are only transferred to deep lake deposits during episodic events (Figure \ref{fig:turbScatter}). The long core (V1 and V2) sediment is composed of nearly 99% silt and clay resulting in laminae couplets that are inferred to have been delivered via suspended sediment from the main Cariboo River. After removal of instantaneous turbidites, the long core sediment records are thought to be most representative of watershed wide trends in river discharge influenced by temperature and precipitation rather than isolated events and inputs from nearby tributaries and hillslopes. 

**In the two sediment sequences collected in this study, differences are observed in the sediment characteristics analyzed at shorter temporal resolutions (< 100 years, Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}a-b). In sediment sequences collected from other alpine lakes in British Columbia, @Evans2000a report an average difference of 7-21% for sediment yield measured across different cores. Therefore differences were expected between between the two records especially at short time-scales, however, at longer time-scales similar trends in varve thickness, grain size and OM are observed between V1 and V2.**

There is a documented range of late Holocene clastic sediment accumulation rates in glacier-fed lakes from across the Canadian Cordillera. Highest rates of > 2 cm/yr are observed in ice-contact to ice-proximal lakes of various sizes [@Desloges1994; @Crookshanks2008], to relatively low rates of < 1 mm yr^-1^ [@Gilbert2012]. The range in accumulation rates has been understood to be a result in the variability of sediment production from glacier processes, the steepness of topography [@Ballantyne2002], the persistence of ice cover and the degree of basin connectivity enhancing or impeding delivery of sediment down valley [@Wohl2019]. 

In the Cariboo Lake basin, the combination of upper watershed area, intervening storage, glacier cover and lake size are considered optimal during this period for the relatively consistent formation of clastic varves. The Cariboo River has two main tributaries, the Upper Cariboo River and the Matthew River which are connected to high alpine peaks and glaciers providing a significant source of sediment (see Figure 2). Lanezi, Sandy and Ghost lakes act as sediment traps eliminating the transfer of coarse sediment and limiting the transfer of finer sediment from the glacier sediment production zones. This results in sediment accumulation rates that are on the low-end for the southeastern Cordillera [@Hodder2006b]. Although connectivity is limited, there are sufficient seasonal contrasts in suspended sediment flux to produce couplets (annual varves) in the main basin of Cariboo Lake over the last two millennia. This is unlike the west arm of Quesnel Lake where sediment rates are 2 to 3 times lower due to significant storage in the much larger upper watershed. 

Lake sediment chronologies typically vary in their sensitivity to regional fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, from annual resolution in lakes with higher accumulation rates [e.g. @Menounos2008c] to centennial-scale in lakes with low accumulation rates [e.g. @Desloges1999]. Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}a shows the (inferred) varve thickness chronology reconstructed as standardized departures from cores V1 and V2. There is a significant amount of noise in the record, typical of a filtered sediment transport system [e.g. @Jerolmack2010], so a lower resolution 30-year moving average is superimposed on the raw couplet thickness data in Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}a. Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}b and \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}c show the lower-resolution temporal patterns in D~50~ grain size and organic matter content, respectively. These trends are compared against the @Moberg2005 regional climate proxy re-analysis for the northern hemisphere (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}d), @Solomina2016 western Canada peak glacier extent estimates (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}e), and @Ljungqvist2016 hydroclimate anomaly estimates for the northern hemisphere (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}f). Most of these are at resolutions of centennial scale or lower. 

For Cariboo Lake, above average varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter are observed for both V1 and V2 from 2.0-1.3 ka BP. In the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia [@Koch2007a; @Osborn2007; @Allen2007; @Clague2010] and in the Interior ranges and Rocky Mountains [@Luckman1993; @Luckman1995] glaciers were generally more extensive prior to 2.0 ka BP than present day. More recently than 2.0 ka BP, there is evidence of the First Millennium Advance (FMA) primarily from the Coast Mountains [@Reyes2006; @Osborn2007] with more recent evidence emerging from the Interior Ranges [@Maurer2012b]. These results cover a range of advance dates between 1.80 and 1.30 ka BP. The increase in sediment production and sediment availability due to extensive glacier advance and then retreat from the FMA may be reflected here by the increase in varve thickness and grain size in the Cariboo Lake record (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}). Observations of an increase in clastic sedimentation rates in the Rocky Mountains were also observed around 1.8 ka BP in Hector Lake [@Leonard1997]. @Maurer2012b show that the Castle Creek Glacier intermittently advanced into On-off Lake and over the Cariboo River watershed divide throughout the late-Holocene between 2.73-2.35, 1.87-1.72, and 1.53-1.42 ka BP (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}). Additional contributions of sediment from the Castle Creek Glacier would help contribute to above average varve thickness and grain size observed in Cariboo Lake from 2.0-1.3 ka BP. However, the above average organic matter observed in Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison} is atypical during an increase of clastic sediment delivery but could be explained by some contributions from increased soil erosion below treeline during a time of higher precipitation rates and subsequent high spring freshet flows.

The coarsening trend of grain size from 750-1000 CE in Cariboo Lake is consistent with evidence of an early Little Ice Age (LIA) glacier advance centering around 1250 CE in the Canadian Rockies [@Luckman1995; @Osborn2001; @Leonard1997], in the Cariboo Lake basin around 1040-1160 CE [@Maurer2012b], and more broadly across western Canada around 1100 CE [@Solomina2016] (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}, D). This period of increased glacier activity also corresponds with the highest temperature anomaly of the Northern Hemisphere MCA [@Moberg2005] (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}). However, @Ljungqvist2016 estimate precipitation to be above average around this time which could have contributed to an increase in glacier extent if corresponding temperatures were low enough. @Steinman2012 studied two lakes in northern Washington, USA which also support above average precipitation for this region during the MCA. Although temperatures are reported as slightly above average during the MCA [@Moberg2005] for the Northern Hemisphere, the increase in glacier activity during this time may have been a result of increased winter precipitation which may have lowered the ELA of glaciers in the Cariboo Lake basin.

The second glacier advance of the LIA, which centers around 1850 CE in the Canadian Rockies [@Luckman2000g; @Leonard1997] coincides with thicker and coarser varves, and a reduction in organic matter in Cariboo Lake (Figure \ref{fig:proxy-comparison}). The change in varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter begins earlier for V1 at around 1750 CE compared to V2 which begins to change around 1825 CE. The discrepancy in the sediment characteristic trends between the two cores is considered small given the uncertainty in couplet counting. Overall, the response of varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter to the second advance of the LIA around 1850 CE exhibits a stronger response compared to earlier phases of the LIA.

Temperature anomalies for the Northern Hemisphere reported by @Moberg2005, are also most negative from 1500-1750 CE. These records suggest there was a strong influence of the LIA climate on glacier activity in the region compared to the rest of the 2 ka record. Following the LIA, around 2000 CE a dramatic decline in organic matter and increase in grain size is observed suggestive of high magnitude clastic sediment delivery. This could be attributed to the increase of sediment availability as glaciers retreated more rapidly from LIA extents and exposed stores of clastic sediments [@Beedle2015]. As glaciers declined from peak LIA extents around 1850 CE [@Leonard1997; @Luckman2000g], an increase in soil development, vegetation growth and subsequent bank stability is expected which may also contribute to a decline in OM as organic content is stored as needleleaf coniferous forest. However, hydraulic mining practices during the Cariboo Gold Rush and deforestation began during the late 1800s may have contributed to this rapid increase of clastic sediments. Human disturbance related controls on sediment inputs for the last 100 years or more are known to confound the climate-glacier-sediment output signal [@Beedle2015].

# Conclusions

The moderated-sized Cariboo Lake provides a record of deglacial and Holocene sediment inputs for central British Columbia. The steep climatic gradient from the wetter, glacier covered, headwaters to the semi-arid, lower elevation zones of the lake, result in sediment input via the main Cariboo Lake delta that is predominately derived from the glacier production zone. This conclusion is supported by the down-lake trends observed in grain-size and organic matter content. The smaller alluvial-fan deltas from side tributaries appear to be paraglacial relic features, similar to those described in @Church1972, and likely formed during deglaciation and the earliest Holocene as no evidence of significant inputs during the Holocene were found in this study. 

  1. Sub-bottom acoustic records provide a coarse temporal resolution chronology of early and mid-Holocene sediment accumulation. The transition from massive to acoustically well-layered sediments is estimated to have occurred around 10.5 to 9 ka BP. There is uncertainty with the timing of this transition as sediment accumulation rates have been extrapolated from the 2 ka old sediment cores. **If correct**, the 10.5 to 9 ka BP transition is similar to other glacier, lake and climate records across British Columbia and Alberta suggesting fairly consistent and rapid withdrawal of valley-bottom glacier ice into higher elevation zones.
  2. If trends observed in other southern Canadian Cordilleran lakes prevail, the early and mid-Holocene input of sediment during the hypsithermal would have been significantly reduced resulting in a Holocene sediment package within the 10-15 m range. Acoustic Facies B most likely represents this unit. **There were limitations in the ability to retrieve sufficiently long cores (> 10-15 m), to confirm this transition of early Holocene to mid-Holocene hypsithermal sedimentary environment observed in the acoustic data.**
  3. Sedimentary structures in the long cores indicated sediment delivery, over the late Holocene to present, is dominated by similar fractions of silt (spring freshet) and clay (winter settling) resulting in the formation of rhythmically laminated couplets that are mainly varves. The fraction of fine clastic sediments observed in the Cariboo Lake cores is high compared to other lakes in the Canadian Cordillera which typically have a larger fraction of coarse sediment from more frequent fall or spring high flows. 
  4. **The physical mechanisms observed in Cariboo Lake and the good agreement between the laminae counting and AMS chronology for core V2 suggests the couplets are varves. However, additional data is required to confirm this.** While it is not possible to develop a chronology that provides a precisely dated high-resolution sediment yield record over the last 2 ka. The observed mean accumulation rate (1.6 mm yr^-1^), the variance in accumulation rates and the low-frequency trends are important indicators of late Holocene environmental change.
  5. Periods of peak glacier extent, such as during the First Millennial Advance (~200 to 700 CE) and Little Ice Age (~1600 to 1900 CE) are best correlated with grain size in Cariboo Lake. The trends in varve thickness were not as strong but still help confirm trends observed in grain size. Organic matter content is the least correlated with the other sediment metrics and may be more sensitive to vegetation changes in the basin. We conclude that sediment accumulation in Cariboo Lake was more sensitive to glacier activity and sediment production during the LIA compared to earlier advances. 
  6. The greatest deviation in varve thickness, grain size, and organic matter above normal occurs after 1860 CE and may be related to climate warming following the LIA. However, there are complications in this watershed via large-scale mining proximal to the lake and some upper watershed deforestation. These land-use and land-cover changes may have also been contributing factors to an increase in sediment delivery to the lake. 
  7. Upstream filtering and storage of glacier eroded sediment may reduce the strength of the climate-sediment signal for Cariboo Lake. However, there is ample evidence that the sediment record spanning the last 2000 years gives better temporal resolution of watershed dynamics compared to other available records in the Interior Ranges of British Columbia. While the results presented here broadly agree with the primary glacier advances over the past 2000 years, further study of the laminated Cariboo Lake sediment record is required to improve the **sediment record chronology and** determine the exact timing and importance (i.e. signal strength) of sediment inputs related to shifts of climate and glacier activity across of the southeastern Canadian Cordillera.
